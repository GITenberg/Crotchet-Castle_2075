<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Love Peacock</span> was born at
Weymouth in 1785.&nbsp; His first poem, &ldquo;The Genius of the
Thames,&rdquo; was in its second edition when he became one of
the friends of Shelley.&nbsp; That was in 1812, when
Shelley&rsquo;s age was twenty, Peacock&rsquo;s
twenty-seven.&nbsp; The acquaintance strengthened, until Peacock
became the friend in whose judgment Shelley put especial
trust.&nbsp; There were many points of agreement.&nbsp; Peacock,
at that time, shared, in a more practical way, Shelley&rsquo;s
desire for root and branch reform; both wore poets, although not
equally gifted, and both loved Plato and the Greek
tragedians.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Crotchet Castle&rdquo; Peacock has
expressed his own delight in Greek literature through the talk of
the Reverend Dr. Folliott.</p>
<p>But Shelley&rsquo;s friendship for Peacock included a trust in
him that was maintained by points of unlikeness.&nbsp; Peacock
was shrewd and witty.&nbsp; He delighted in extravagance of a
satire which usually said more than it meant, but always rested
upon a foundation of good sense.&nbsp; Then also there was a
touch of the poet to give grace to the utterances of a
clear-headed man of the world.&nbsp; It was Peacock who gave its
name to Shelley&rsquo;s poem of &ldquo;Alastor, or the Spirit of
Solitude,&rdquo; published in 1816.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Spirit of
Solitude&rdquo; being treated as a spirit of evil, Peacock
suggested calling it &ldquo;Alastor,&rdquo; since the Greek
&#7936;&lambda;&#8049;&sigma;&tau;&omega;&rho; means an evil
genius.</p>
<p>Peacock&rsquo;s novels are unlike those of other men: they are
the genuine expressions of an original and independent
mind.&nbsp; His reading and his thinking ran together; there is
free quotation, free play of wit and satire, grace of invention
too, but always unconventional.&nbsp; The story is always
pleasant, although always secondary to the play of thought for
which it gives occasion.&nbsp; He quarrelled with verse,
whimsically but in all seriousness, in an article on &ldquo;The
Four Ages of Poetry,&rdquo; contributed in 1820 to a short-lived
journal, &ldquo;Ollier&rsquo;s Literary Miscellany.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The four ages were, he said, the iron age, the Bardic; the
golden, the Homeric; the silver, the Virgilian; and the brass, in
which he himself lived.&nbsp; &ldquo;A poet in our time,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;is a semi-barbarian in a civilised community . .
. The highest inspirations of poetry are resolvable into three
ingredients: the rant of unregulated passion, the whining of
exaggerated feeling, and the cant of factitious sentiment; and
can, therefore, serve only to ripen a splendid lunatic like
Alexander, a puling driveller like Werter, or a morbid dreamer
like Wordsworth.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another part of this essay he
says: &ldquo;While the historian and the philosopher are
advancing in and accelerating the progress of knowledge, the poet
is wallowing in the rubbish of departed ignorance, and raking up
the ashes of dead savages to find gewgaws and rattles for the
grown babies of the age.&nbsp; Mr. Scott digs up the poacher and
cattle-stealers of the ancient Border.&nbsp; Lord Byron cruises
for thieves and pirates on the shores of the Morea and among the
Greek islands.&nbsp; Mr. Southey wades through ponderous volumes
of travels and old chronicles, from which he carefully selects
all that is false, useless, and absurd, as being essentially
poetical; and when he has a commonplace book full of
monstrosities, strings them into an epic.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so
forth; Peacock going on to characterise, in further illustration
of his argument, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Moore, and
Campbell.&nbsp; He did not refer to Shelley; and Shelley read his
friend&rsquo;s whimsical attack on poetry with all good humour,
proceeding to reply to it with a &ldquo;Defence of Poetry,&rdquo;
which would have appeared in the same journal, if the journal had
survived.&nbsp; In this novel of &ldquo;Crotchet Castle&rdquo;
there is the same good-humoured exaggeration in the treatment of
&ldquo;our learned friend&rdquo;&mdash;Lord Brougham&mdash;to
whom and to whose labours for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge
there are repeated allusions.&nbsp; In one case Peacock
associates the labours of &ldquo;our learned friend&rdquo; for
the general instruction of the masses with encouragement of
robbery (page 172), and in another with body-snatching, or,
worse,&mdash;murder for dissection (page 99).&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Lord deliver me from the learned friend!&rdquo; says Dr.
Folliott.&nbsp; Brougham&rsquo;s elevation to a peerage in
November, 1830, as Lord Brougham and Vaux, is referred to on page
177, where he is called Sir Guy do Vaux.&nbsp; It is not to be
forgotten, in the reading, that this story was written in 1831,
the year before the passing of the Reform Bill.&nbsp; It ends
with a scene suggested by the agricultural riots of that
time.&nbsp; In the ninth chapter, again, there is a passage
dealing with Sir Walter Scott after the fashion of the criticisms
in the &ldquo;Four Ages of Poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this critical
satire gave nobody pain.&nbsp; Always there was a ground-work of
good sense, and the broad sweep of the satire was utterly unlike
the nibbling censure of the men whose wit is tainted with
ill-humour.&nbsp; We may see also that the poet&rsquo;s nature
cannot be expelled.&nbsp; In this volume we should find the touch
of a poet&rsquo;s hand in the tale itself when dealing with the
adventures of Mr. Chainmail, while he stays at the Welsh mountain
inn, if the story did not again and again break out into actual
song, for it includes half-a-dozen little poems.</p>
<p>When Peacock wrote his attack on Poetry, he had, only two
years before, produced a poem of his
own&mdash;&ldquo;Rhododaphne&rdquo;&mdash;with a Greek fancy of
the true and the false love daintily worked out.&nbsp; It was his
chief work in verse, and gave much pleasure to a few, among them
his friend Shelley.&nbsp; But he felt that, as the world went, he
was not strong enough to help it by his singing, so he confined
his writing to the novels, in which he could speak his mind in
his own way, while doing his duty by his country in the East
India House, where he obtained a post in 1818.&nbsp; From 1836 to
1856, when he retired on a pension, he was Examiner of India
Correspondence.&nbsp; Peacock died in 1866, aged eighty-one.</p>

Mac Q. E. D., son of a demonstration; Mr. Skionar, the

Phil(o)pot(amos).</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE VILLA.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p><i>Captain Jamy</i>.&nbsp; I wad full fain hear
some question &rsquo;tween you tway.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Henry</span>
V.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of those beautiful valleys,
through which the Thames (not yet polluted by the tide, the
scouring of cities, or even the minor defilement of the sandy
streams of Surrey) rolls a clear flood through flowery meadows,
under the shade of old beech woods, and the smooth mossy
greensward of the chalk hills (which pour into it their tributary
rivulets, as pure and pellucid as the fountain of Bandusium, or
the wells of Scamander, by which the wives and daughters of the
Trojans washed their splendid garments in the days of peace,
before the coming of the Greeks); in one of those beautiful
valleys, on a bold round-surfaced lawn, spotted with juniper,
that opened itself in the bosom of an old wood, which rose with a
steep, but not precipitous ascent, from the river to the summit
of the hill, stood the castellated villa of a retired
citizen.&nbsp; Ebenezer Mac Crotchet, Esquire, was the
London-born offspring of a worthy native of the &ldquo;north
countrie,&rdquo; who had walked up to London on a commercial
adventure, with all his surplus capital, not very neatly tied up
in a not very clean handkerchief, suspended over his shoulder
from the end of a hooked stick, extracted from the first hedge on
his pilgrimage; and who, after having worked himself a step or
two up the ladder of life, had won the virgin heart of the only
daughter of a highly respectable merchant of Duke&rsquo;s Place,
with whom he inherited the honest fruits of a long series of
ingenuous dealings.</p>
<p>Mr. Mac Crotchet had derived from his mother the instinct, and
from his father the rational principle, of enriching himself at
the expense of the rest of mankind, by all the recognised modes
of accumulation on the windy side of the law.&nbsp; After passing
many years in the Alley, watching the turn of the market, and
playing many games almost as desperate as that of the soldier of
Lucullus, the fear of losing what he had so righteously gained
predominated over the sacred thirst of paper-money; his caution
got the better of his instinct, or rather transferred it from the
department of acquisition to that of conservation.&nbsp; His
friend, Mr. Ramsbottom, the zodiacal mythologist, told him that
he had done well to withdraw from the region of Uranus or Brahma,
the Maker, to that of Saturn or Veeshnu, the Preserver, before he
fell under the eye of Jupiter or Seva, the Destroyer, who might
have struck him down at a blow.</p>
<p>It is said that a Scotchman, returning home after some
years&rsquo; residence in England, being asked what he thought of
the English, answered: &ldquo;They hanna ower muckle sense, but
they are an unco braw people to live amang;&rdquo; which would be
a very good story, if it were not rendered apocryphal by the
incredible circumstance of the Scotchman going back.</p>
<p>Mr. Mac Crotchet&rsquo;s experience had given him a just title
to make, in his own person, the last-quoted observation, but he
would have known better than to go back, even if himself, and not
his father, had been the first comer of his line from the
north.&nbsp; He had married an English Christian, and, having
none of the Scotch accent, was ungracious enough to be ashamed of
his blood.&nbsp; He was desirous to obliterate alike the Hebrew
and Caledonian vestiges in his name, and signed himself E. M.
Crotchet, which by degrees induced the majority of his neighbours
to think that his name was Edward Matthew.&nbsp; The more
effectually to sink the Mac, he christened his villa
&ldquo;Crotchet Castle,&rdquo; and determined to hand down to
posterity the honours of Crotchet of Crotchet.&nbsp; He found it
essential to his dignity to furnish himself with a coat of arms,
which, after the proper ceremonies (payment being the principal),
he obtained, videlicet: Crest, a crotchet rampant, in A sharp;
Arms, three empty bladders, turgescent, to show how opinions are
formed; three bags of gold, pendent, to show why they are
maintained; three naked swords, tranchant, to show how they are
administered; and three barbers&rsquo; blocks, gaspant, to show
how they are swallowed.</p>
<p>Mr. Crotchet was left a widower, with two children; and, after
the death of his wife, so strong was his sense of the blessed
comfort she had been to him, that he determined never to give any
other woman an opportunity of obliterating the happy
recollection.</p>
<p>He was not without a plausible pretence for styling his villa
a castle, for, in its immediate vicinity, and within his own
enclosed domain, were the manifest traces, on the brow of the
hill, of a Roman station, or <i>castellum</i>, which was still
called the &ldquo;Castle&rdquo; by the country people.&nbsp; The
primitive mounds and trenches, merely overgrown with greensward,
with a few patches of juniper and box on the vallum, and a
solitary ancient beech surmounting the place of the
pr&aelig;torium, presented nearly the same depths, heights,
slopes, and forms, which the Roman soldiers had originally given
them.&nbsp; From this cartel Mr. Crotchet christened his
villa.&nbsp; With his rustic neighbours he was, of course,
immediately and necessarily a squire: Squire Crotchet of the
Castle; and he seemed to himself to settle down as naturally into
an English country gentleman, as if his parentage had been as
innocent of both Scotland and Jerusalem, as his education was of
Rome and Athens.</p>
<p>But as, though you expel nature with a pitch-fork, she will
yet always come back; he could not become, like a true-born
English squire, part and parcel of the barley-giving earth; he
could not find in game-bagging, poacher-shooting,
trespasser-pounding, footpath-stopping, common-enclosing,
rack-renting, and all the other liberal pursuits and pastimes
which make a country gentleman an ornament to the world and a
blessing to the poor: he could not find in these valuable and
amiable occupations, and in a corresponding range of ideas,
nearly commensurate with that of the great King Nebuchadnezzar
when he was turned out to grass; he could not find in this great
variety of useful action, and vast field of comprehensive
thought, modes of filling up his time that accorded with his
Caledonian instinct.&nbsp; The inborn love of disputation, which
the excitements and engagements of a life of business had
smothered, burst forth through the calmer surface of a rural
life.&nbsp; He grew as fain as Captain Jamy, &ldquo;to hear some
argument betwixt ony tway,&rdquo; and being very hospitable in
his establishment, and liberal in his invitations, a numerous
detachment from the advanced guard of the &ldquo;march of
intellect,&rdquo; often marched down to Crotchet Castle.</p>
<p>When the fashionable season filled London with exhibitors of
all descriptions, lecturers and else, Mr. Crotchet was in his
glory; for, in addition to the perennial literati of the
metropolis, he had the advantage of the visits of a number of
hardy annuals, chiefly from the north, who, as the interval of
their metropolitan flowering allowed, occasionally accompanied
their London brethren in excursions to Crotchet Castle.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, he took very naturally to political
economy, read all the books on the subject which were put forth
by his own countrymen, attended all lectures thereon, and boxed
the technology of the sublime science as expertly as an able
seaman boxes the compass.</p>
<p>With this agreeable mania he had the satisfaction of biting
his son, the hope of his name and race, who had borne off from
Oxford the highest academical honours; and who, treading in his
father&rsquo;s footsteps to honour and fortune, had, by means of
a portion of the old gentleman&rsquo;s surplus capital, made
himself a junior partner in the eminent loan-jobbing firm of
Catchflat and Company.&nbsp; Here, in the days of paper
prosperity, he applied his science-illumined genius to the
blowing of bubbles, the bursting of which sent many a poor devil
to the gaol, the workhouse, or the bottom of the river, but left
young Crotchet rolling in riches.</p>
<p>These riches he had been on the point of doubling, by a
marriage with the daughter of Mr. Touchandgo, the great banker,
when, one foggy morning, Mr. Touchandgo and the contents of his
till were suddenly reported absent; and as the fortune which the
young gentleman had intended to marry was not forthcoming, this
tender affair of the heart was nipped in the bud.</p>
<p>Miss Touchandgo did not meet the shock of separation quite so
complacently as the young gentleman: for he lost only the lady,
whereas she lost a fortune as well as a lover.&nbsp; Some jewels,
which had glittered on her beautiful person as brilliantly as the
bubble of her father&rsquo;s wealth had done in the eyes of his
gudgeons, furnished her with a small portion of paper-currency;
and this, added to the contents of a fairy purse of gold, which
she found in her shoe on the eventful morning when Mr. Touchandgo
melted into thin air, enabled her to retreat into North Wales,
where she took up her lodging in a farm-house in Merionethshire,
and boarded very comfortably for a trifling payment, and the
additional consideration of teaching English, French, and music,
to the little Ap-Llymrys.&nbsp; In the course of this occupation
she acquired sufficient knowledge of Welsh to converse with the
country people.</p>
<p>She climbed the mountains, and descended the dingles, with a
foot which daily habit made by degrees almost as steady as a
native&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She became the nymph of the scene; and if
she sometimes pined in thought for her faithless Strephon, her
melancholy was anything but green and yellow: it was as genuine
white and red as occupation, mountain air, thyme-fed mutton,
thick cream, and fat bacon could make it: to say nothing of an
occasional glass of double X, which Ap-Llymry, who yielded to no
man west of the Wrekin in brewage, never failed to press upon her
at dinner and supper.&nbsp; He was also earnest, and sometimes
successful, in the recommendation of his mead, and most
pertinacious on winter nights in enforcing a trial of the virtues
of his elder wine.&nbsp; The young lady&rsquo;s personal
appearance, consequently, formed a very advantageous contrast to
that of her quondam lover, whose physiognomy the intense
anxieties of his bubble-blowing days, notwithstanding their
triumphant result, had left blighted, sallowed, and
crow&rsquo;s-footed, to a degree not far below that of the fallen
spirit who, in the expressive language of German romance, is
described as &ldquo;scathed by the ineradicable traces of the
thunderbolts of Heaven;&rdquo; so that, contemplating their
relative geological positions, the poor deserted damsel was
flourishing on slate, while her rich and false young knight was
pining on chalk.</p>
<p>Squire Crotchet had also one daughter, whom he had christened
Lemma, and who, as likely to be endowed with a very ample fortune
was, of course, an object very tempting to many young soldiers of
fortune, who were marching with the march of mind, in a good
condition for taking castles, as far as not having a groat is a
qualification for such exploits.&nbsp; She was also a glittering
bait to divers young squires expectant (whose fathers were too
well acquainted with the occult signification of mortgage), and
even to one or two sprigs of nobility, who thought that the
lining of a civic purse would superinduce a very passable
factitious nap upon a thread-bare title.&nbsp; The young lady had
received an expensive and complicated education, complete in all
the elements of superficial display.&nbsp; She was thus eminently
qualified to be the companion of any masculine luminary who had
kept due pace with the &ldquo;astounding progress&rdquo; of
intelligence.&nbsp; It must be confessed, that a man who has not
kept due pace with it, is not very easily found: this march being
one of that &ldquo;astounding&rdquo; character in which it seems
impossible that the rear can be behind the van.&nbsp; The young
lady was also tolerably good looking: north of Tweed, or in
Palestine, she would probable have been a beauty; but for the
valleys of the Thames she was perhaps a little too much to the
taste of Solomon, and had a nose which rather too prominently
suggested the idea of the tower of Lebanon, which looked towards
Damascus.</p>
<p>In a village in the vicinity of the Castle was the vicarage of
the Reverend Doctor Folliott, a gentleman endowed with a
tolerable stock of learning, an interminable swallow, and an
indefatigable pair of lungs.&nbsp; His pre-eminence in the latter
faculty gave occasion to some etymologists to ring changes on his
name, and to decide that it was derived from Follis Optimus,
softened through an Italian medium into Folle Ottimo, contracted
poetically into Folleotto, and elided Anglic&eacute; into
Folliott, signifying a first-rate pair of bellows.&nbsp; He
claimed to be descended lineally from the illustrious Gilbert
Folliott, the eminent theologian, who was a Bishop of London in
the twelfth century, whose studies were interrupted in the dead
of night by the Devil, when a couple of epigrams passed between
them, and the Devil, of course, proved the smaller wit of the
two.</p>
<p>This reverend gentleman, being both learned and jolly, became
by degrees an indispensable ornament to the new squire&rsquo;s
table.&nbsp; Mr. Crotchet himself was eminently jolly, though by
no means eminently learned.&nbsp; In the latter respect he took
after the great majority of the sons of his father&rsquo;s land;
had a smattering of many things, and a knowledge of none; but
possessed the true northern art of making the most of his
intellectual harlequin&rsquo;s jacket, by keeping the best
patches always bright and prominent.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MARCH OF MIND.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>Quoth Ralpho: nothing but the abuse<br />
Of human learning you produce.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Butler</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> bless my soul,
sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the Reverend Doctor Folliott, bursting, one
fine May morning, into the breakfast-room at Crotchet Castle,
&ldquo;I am out of all patience with this march of mind.&nbsp;
Here has my house been nearly burned down by my cook taking it
into her head to study hydrostatics in a sixpenny tract,
published by the Steam Intellect Society, and written by a
learned friend who is for doing all the world&rsquo;s business as
well as his own, and is equally well qualified to handle every
branch of human knowledge.&nbsp; I have a great abomination of
this learned friend; as author, lawyer, and politician, he is
<i>triformis</i>, like Hecate; and in every one of his three
forms he is <i>bifrons</i>, like Janus; the true Mr.
Facing-both-ways of Vanity Fair.&nbsp; My cook must read his
rubbish in bed; and, as might naturally be expected, she dropped
suddenly fast asleep, overturned the candle, and set the curtains
in a blaze.&nbsp; Luckily, the footman went into the room at the
moment, in time to tear down the curtains and throw them into the
chimney, and a pitcher of water on her nightcap extinguished her
wick; she is a greasy subject, and would have burned like a short
mould.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reverend gentleman exhaled his grievance without looking
to the right or to the left; at length, turning on his pivot, he
perceived that the room was full of company, consisting of young
Crotchet, and some visitors whom he had brought from
London.&nbsp; The Reverend Doctor Folliott was introduced to Mr.
Mac Quedy, the economist; Mr. Skionar, the transcendental poet;
Mr. Firedamp, the meteorologist; and Lord Bossnowl, son of the
Earl of Foolincourt, and member for the borough of
Rogueingrain.</p>
<p>The divine took his seat at the breakfast-table, and began to
compose his spirits by the gentle sedative of a large cup of tea,
the demulcent of a well-buttered muffin, and the tonic of a small
lobster.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;You are a man of taste,
Mr. Crotchet.&nbsp; A man of taste is seen at once in the array
of his breakfast-table.&nbsp; It is the foot of Hercules, the
far-shining face of the great work, according to Pindar&rsquo;s
doctrine:
&#7936;&rho;&chi;&omicron;&mu;&#8051;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;

The breakfast is the
&pi;&rho;&#8057;&sigmaf;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&nu; of the great
work of the day.&nbsp; Chocolate, coffee, tea, cream, eggs, ham,
tongue, cold fowl, all these are good, and bespeak good knowledge
in him who sets them forth: but the touchstone is fish: anchovy
is the first step, prawns and shrimps the second; and I laud him
who reaches even to these: potted char and lampreys are the
third, and a fine stretch of progression; but lobster is, indeed,
matter for a May morning, and demands a rare combination of
knowledge and virtue in him who sets it forth.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, and what say you to a
fine fresh trout, hot and dry, in a napkin? or a herring out of
the water into the frying-pan, on the shore of Loch Fyne?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, I say every nation
has some eximious virtue; and your country is pre-eminent in the
glory of fish for breakfast.&nbsp; We have much to learn from you
in that line at any rate.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;And in many others, sir, I
believe.&nbsp; Morals and metaphysics, politics and political
economy, the way to make the most of all the modifications of
smoke; steam, gas, and paper currency; you have all these to
learn from us; in short, all the arts and sciences.&nbsp; We are
the modern Athenians.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I, for one, sir, am
content to learn nothing from you but the art and science of fish
for breakfast.&nbsp; Be content, sir, to rival the Boeotians,
whose redeeming virtue was in fish, touching which point you may
consult Aristophanes and his scholiast in the passage of
Lysistrata, &#7936;&lambda;&lambda;&rsquo;
&#7940;&phi;&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon; &tau;&#8048;&sigmaf;
&#7952;&gamma;&chi;&#8051;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;, and
leave the name of Athenians to those who have a sense of the
beautiful, and a perception of metrical quantity.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Then, sir, I presume you set no
value on the right principles of rent, profit, wages, and
currency?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;My principles, sir, in
these things are, to take as much as I can get, and pay no more
than I can help.&nbsp; These are every man&rsquo;s principles,
whether they be the right principles or no.&nbsp; There, sir, is
political economy in a nutshell.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;The principles, sir, which
regulate production and consumption are independent of the will
of any individual as to giving or taking, and do not lie in a
nutshell by any means.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, I will thank you for
a leg of that capon.</p>
<p><i>Lord Bossnowl</i>.&mdash;But, sir, by-the-bye, how came
your footman to be going into your cook&rsquo;s room?&nbsp; It
was very providential to be sure, but&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, as good came of it, I
shut my eyes, and ask no questions.&nbsp; I suppose he was going
to study hydrostatics, and he found himself under the necessity
of practising hydraulics.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Firedamp</i>.&mdash;Sir, you seem to make very light of
science.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Yes, sir, such science as
the learned friend deals in: everything for everybody, science
for all, schools for all, rhetoric for all, law for all, physic
for all, words for all, and sense for none.&nbsp; I say, sir, law
for lawyers, and cookery for cooks: and I wish the learned
friend, for all his life, a cook that will pass her time in
studying his works; then every dinner he sits down to at home, he
will sit on the stool of repentance.</p>
<p><i>Lord Bossnowl</i>.&mdash;Now really that would be too
severe: my cook should read nothing but Ude.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No, sir! let Ude and the
learned friend singe fowls together; let both avaunt from my
kitchen.&nbsp; &Theta;&#973;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf; &delta;&rsquo;
&#7952;&pi;&#943;&theta;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&epsilon;
&beta;&epsilon;&beta;&#942;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf;.&nbsp;
Ude says an elegant supper may be given with sandwiches.&nbsp;
<i>Horresco referens</i>.&nbsp; An elegant supper.&nbsp;
<i>D&icirc; meliora piis</i>.&nbsp; No Ude for me.&nbsp;
Conviviality went out with punch and suppers.&nbsp; I cherish
their memory.&nbsp; I sup when I can, but not upon
sandwiches.&nbsp; To offer me a sandwich, when I am looking for a
supper, is to add insult to injury.&nbsp; Let the learned friend,
and the modern Athenians, sup upon sandwiches.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Nay, sir; the modern Athenians
know better than that.&nbsp; A literary supper in sweet
Edinbro&rsquo; would cure you of the prejudice you seem to
cherish against us.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, well; there is
cogency in a good supper; a good supper in these degenerate days
bespeaks a good man; but much more is wanted to make up an
Athenian.&nbsp; Athenians, indeed! where is your theatre? who
among you has written a comedy? where is your Attic salt? which
of you can tell who was Jupiter&rsquo;s great-grandfather? or
what metres will successively remain, if you take off the three
first syllables, one by one, from a pure antispastic acatalectic
tetrameter?&nbsp; Now, sir, there are three questions for you:
theatrical, mythological, and metrical; to every one of which an
Athenian would give an answer that would lay me prostrate in my
own nothingness.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, as to your metre and
your mythology, they may e&rsquo;en wait a wee.&nbsp; For your
comedy there is the &ldquo;Gentle Shepherd&rdquo; of the divine
Allan Ramsay.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;The &ldquo;Gentle
Shepherd&rdquo;!&nbsp; It is just as much a comedy as the Book of
Job.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, if none of us have
written a comedy, I cannot see that it is any such great matter,
any more than I can conjecture what business a man can have at
this time of day with Jupiter&rsquo;s great-grandfather.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;The great business is,
sir, that you call yourselves Athenians, while you know nothing
that the Athenians thought worth knowing, and dare not show your
noses before the civilised world in the practice of any one art
in which they were excellent.&nbsp; Modern Athens, sir! the
assumption is a personal affront to every man who has a Sophocles
in his library.&nbsp; I will thank you for an anchovy.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Metaphysics, sir;
metaphysics.&nbsp; Logic and moral philosophy.&nbsp; There we are
at home.&nbsp; The Athenians only sought the way, and we have
found it; and to all this we have added political economy, the
science of sciences.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;A hyperbarbarous
technology, that no Athenian ear could have borne.&nbsp; Premises
assumed without evidence, or in spite of it; and conclusions
drawn from them so logically, that they must necessarily be
erroneous.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;I cannot agree with you, Mr. Mac
Quedy, that you have found the true road of metaphysics, which
the Athenians only sought.&nbsp; The Germans have found it, sir:
the sublime Kant and his disciples.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;I have read the sublime Kant, sir,
with an anxious desire to understand him, and I confess I have
not succeeded.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;He wants the two great
requisites of head and tail.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;Transcendentalism is the philosophy
of intuition, the development of universal convictions; truths
which are inherent in the organisation of mind, which cannot be
obliterated, though they may be obscured, by superstitious
prejudice on the one hand, and by the Aristotelian logic on the
other.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, I have no notion of
logic obscuring a question.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;There is only one true logic, which
is the transcendental; and this can prove only the one true
philosophy, which is also the transcendental.&nbsp; The logic of
your Modern Athens can prove everything equally; and that is, in
my opinion, tantamount to proving nothing at all.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;The sentimental against the
rational, the intuitive against the inductive, the ornamental
against the useful, the intense against the tranquil, the
romantic against the classical; these are great and interesting
controversies, which I should like, before I die, to see
satisfactorily settled.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Firedamp</i>.&mdash;There is another great question,
greater than all these, seeing that it is necessary to be alive
in order to settle any question; and this is the question of
water against human life.&nbsp; Wherever there is water, there is
malaria, and wherever there is malaria, there are the elements of
death.&nbsp; The great object of a wise man should be to live on
a gravelly hill, without so much as a duck-pond within ten miles
of him, eschewing cisterns and waterbutts, and taking care that
there be no gravel-pits for lodging the rain.&nbsp; The sun sucks
up infection from water, wherever it exists on the face of the
earth.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, you have for
you the authority of the ancient mystagogue, who said:
&rsquo;&Epsilon;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&nu; &#8020;&delta;&omega;&rho;
&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&#8135;
&theta;&#8049;&nu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;.&nbsp; For my
part I care not a rush (or any other aquatic and inesculent
vegetable) who or what sucks up either the water or the
infection.&nbsp; I think the proximity of wine a matter of much
more importance than the longinquity of water.&nbsp; You are here
within a quarter of a mile of the Thames, but in the cellar of my
friend, Mr. Crotchet, there is the talismanic antidote of a
thousand dozen of old wine; a beautiful spectacle, I assure you,
and a model of arrangement.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Firedamp</i>.&mdash;Sir, I feel the malignant influence
of the river in every part of my system.&nbsp; Nothing but my
great friendship for Mr. Crotchet would have brought me so nearly
within the jaws of the lion.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;After dinner, sir, after
dinner, I will meet you on this question.&nbsp; I shall then be
armed for the strife.&nbsp; You may fight like Hercules against
Achelous, but I shall flourish the Bacchic thyrsus, which changed
rivers into wine: as Nonnus sweetly sings,
&Omicron;&#8055;&nu;&omega;
&kappa;&upsilon;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&#8057;&epsilon;&nu;&tau;&iota;
&mu;&#8051;&lambda;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&epsilon;&lambda;&#8049;&rho;&upsilon;&zeta;&epsilon;&nu;
&Upsilon;&delta;&#8049;&sigmaf;&pi;&eta;&sigmaf;.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>, <i>jun.</i>&mdash;I hope, Mr. Firedamp,
you will let your friendship carry you a little closer into the
jaws of the lion.&nbsp; I am fitting up a flotilla of
pleasure-boats, with spacious cabins, and a good cellar, to carry
a choice philosophical party up the Thames and Severn, into the
Ellesmere canal, where we shall be among the mountains of North
Wales; which we may climb or not, as we think proper; but we
will, at any rate, keep our floating hotel well provisioned, and
we will try to settle all the questions over which a shadow of
doubt yet hangs in the world of philosophy.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Firedamp</i>.&mdash;Out of my great friendship for you,
I will certainly go; but I do not expect to survive the
experiment.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;<i>Alter erit tum
Tiphys</i>, <i>et altera qu&aelig; vehat Argo Delectos
Heroas</i>.&nbsp; I will be of the party, though I must hire an
officiating curate, and deprive poor dear Mrs. Folliott, for
several weeks, of the pleasure of combing my wig.</p>
<p><i>Lord Bossnowl</i>.&mdash;I hope, if I am to be of the
party, our ship is not to be the ship of fools: He! he!</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;If you are one of the
party, sir, it most assuredly will not: Ha! ha!</p>
<p><i>Lord Bossnowl</i>.&mdash;Pray sir, what do you mean by Ha!
ha!?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Precisely, sir, what you
mean by He! he!</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;You need not dispute about terms;
they are two modes of expressing merriment, with or without
reason; reason being in no way essential to mirth.&nbsp; No man
should ask another why he laughs, or at what, seeing that he does
not always know, and that, if he does, he is not a responsible
agent.&nbsp; Laughter is an involuntary action of certain
muscles, developed in the human species by the progress of
civilisation.&nbsp; The savage never laughs.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No, sir, he has nothing to
laugh at.&nbsp; Give him Modern Athens, the &ldquo;learned
friend,&rdquo; and the Steam Intellect Society.&nbsp; They will
develop his muscles.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE ROMAN CAMP.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>He loved her more then seven yere,<br />
Yet was he of her love never the nere;<br />
He was not ryche of golde and fe,<br />
A gentyll man forsoth was he.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>The Squyr of Lowe Degre</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Reverend Doctor Folliott having
promised to return to dinner, walked back to his vicarage,
meditating whether he should pass the morning in writing his next
sermon, or in angling for trout, and had nearly decided in favour
of the latter proposition, repeating to himself, with great
unction, the lines of Chaucer:</p>
<blockquote><p>And as for me, though that I can but lite,<br />
On bokis for to read I me delite,<br />
And to &rsquo;hem yeve I faithe and full credence,<br />
And in mine herte have &rsquo;hem in reverence,<br />

That fro my bokis makith me to gone,<br />

Save certainly whan that the month of Maie<br />
Is cousin, and I here the foulis sing,<br />
And that the flouris ginnin for to spring,<br />
Farwell my boke and my devocion:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when his attention was attracted by a young gentleman who was
sitting on a camp stool with a portfolio on his knee, taking a
sketch of the Roman Camp, which, as has been already said, was
within the enclosed domain of Mr. Crotchet.&nbsp; The young
stranger, who had climbed over the fence, espying the portly
divine, rose up, and hoped that he was not trespassing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By no means, sir,&rdquo; said the divine, &ldquo;all the
arts and sciences are welcome here; music, painting, and poetry;
hydrostatics and political economy; meteorology,
transcendentalism, and fish for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Stranger</i>.&mdash;A pleasant association, sir, and a
liberal and discriminating hospitality.&nbsp; This is an old
British camp, I believe, sir?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Roman, sir; Roman;
undeniably Roman.&nbsp; The vallum is past controversy.&nbsp; It
was not a camp, sir, a <i>castrum</i>, but a <i>castellum</i>, a
little camp, or watch-station, to which was attached, on the peak
of the adjacent hill, a beacon for transmitting alarms.&nbsp; You
will find such here and there, all along the range of chalk
hills, which traverses the country from north-east to south-west,
and along the base of which runs the ancient Iknield road,
whereof you may descry a portion in that long straight white
line.</p>
<p><i>The Stranger</i>.&mdash;I beg your pardon, sir; do I
understand this place to be your property?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;It is not mine, sir: the
more is the pity; yet is it so far well, that the owner is my
good friend, and a highly respectable gentleman.</p>
<p><i>The Stranger</i>.&mdash;Good and respectable, sir, I take
it, means rich?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;That is their meaning,
sir.</p>
<p><i>The Stranger</i>.&mdash;I understand the owner to be a Mr.
Crotchet.&nbsp; He has a handsome daughter, I am told.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;He has, sir.&nbsp; Her
eyes are like the fish-pools of Heshbon, by the gate of
Bethrabbim; and she is to have a handsome fortune, to which
divers disinterested gentlemen are paying their addresses.&nbsp;
Perhaps you design to be one of them?</p>
<p><i>The Stranger</i>.&mdash;No, sir; I beg pardon if my
questions seem impertinent; I have no such design.&nbsp; There is
a son too, I believe, sir, a great and successful blower of
bubbles?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;A hero, sir, in his
line.&nbsp; Never did angler in September hook more gudgeons.</p>
<p><i>The Stranger</i>.&mdash;To say the truth, two very amiable
young people, with whom I have some little acquaintance, Lord
Bossnowl, and his sister, Lady Clarinda, are reported to be on
the point of concluding a double marriage with Miss Crotchet and
her brother; by way of putting a new varnish on old
nobility.&nbsp; Lord Foolincourt, their father, is terribly poor
for a lord who owns a borough.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, the Crotchets
have plenty of money, and the old gentleman&rsquo;s weak point is
a hankering after high blood.&nbsp; I saw your acquaintance, Lord
Bossnowl, this morning, but I did not see his sister.&nbsp; She
may be there, nevertheless, and doing fashionable justice to this
fine May morning, by lying in bed till noon.</p>
<p><i>The Stranger</i>.&mdash;Young Mr. Crotchet, sir, has been,
like his father, the architect of his own fortune, has he
not?&nbsp; An illustrious example of the reward of honesty and
industry?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;As to honesty, sir, he
made his fortune in the city of London, and if that commodity be
of any value there, you will find it in the price current.&nbsp;
I believe it is below par, like the shares of young
Crotchet&rsquo;s fifty companies.&nbsp; But his progress has not
been exactly like his father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It has been more
rapid, and he started with more advantages.&nbsp; He began with a
fine capital from his father.&nbsp; The old gentleman divided his
fortune into three not exactly equal portions; one for himself,
one for his daughter, and one for his son, which he handed over
to him, saying, &ldquo;Take it once for all, and make the most of
it; if you lose it where I won it, not another stiver do you get
from me during my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, sir, young Crotchet
doubled, and trebled, and quadrupled it, and is, as you say, a
striking example of the reward of industry; not that I think his
labour has been so great as his luck.</p>
<p><i>The Stranger</i>.&mdash;But, sir, is all this solid? is
there no danger of reaction? no day of reckoning to cut down in
an hour prosperity that has grown up like a mushroom?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Nay, sir, I know
not.&nbsp; I do not pry into these matters.&nbsp; I am, for my
own part, very well satisfied with the young gentleman.&nbsp; Let
those who are not so look to themselves.&nbsp; It is quite enough
for me that he came down last night from London, and that he had
the good sense to bring with him a basket of lobsters.&nbsp; Sir,
I wish you a good morning.</p>
<p>The stranger having returned the reverend gentleman&rsquo;s
good morning, resumed his sketch, and was intently employed on it
when Mr. Crotchet made his appearance with Mr. Mac Quedy and Mr.
Skionar, whom he was escorting round his grounds, according to
his custom with new visitors; the principal pleasure of
possessing an extensive domain being that of showing it to other
people.&nbsp; Mr. Mac Quedy, according also to the laudable
custom of his countrymen, had been appraising everything that
fell under his observation; but, on arriving at the Roman camp,
of which the value was purely imaginary, he contented himself
with exclaiming: &ldquo;Eh! this is just a curiosity, and very
pleasant to sit in on a summer day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;And call up the days of old, when
the Roman eagle spread its wings in the place of that beechen
foliage.&nbsp; It gives a fine idea of duration, to think that
that fine old tree must have sprung from the earth ages after
this camp was formed.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;How old, think you, may the tree
be?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;I have records which show it to be
three hundred years old.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;That is a great age for a beech in
good condition.&nbsp; But you see the camp is some fifteen
hundred years, or so, older; and three times six being eighteen,
I think you get a clearer idea of duration out of the simple
arithmetic, than out of your eagle and foliage.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;That is a very unpoetical, if not
unphilosophical, mode of viewing antiquities.&nbsp; Your
philosophy is too literal for our imperfect vision.&nbsp; We
cannot look directly into the nature of things; we can only catch
glimpses of the mighty shadow in the camera obscura of
transcendental intelligence.&nbsp; These six and eighteen are
only words to which we give conventional meanings.&nbsp; We can
reason, but we cannot feel, by help of them.&nbsp; The tree and
the eagle, contemplated in the ideality of space and time, become
subjective realities, that rise up as landmarks in the mystery of
the past.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, if you understand that,
I wish you joy.&nbsp; But I must be excused for holding that my
proposition, three times six are eighteen, is more intelligible
than yours.&nbsp; A worthy friend of mine, who is a sort of
amateur in philosophy, criticism, politics, and a wee bit of many
things more, says: &ldquo;Men never begin to study antiquities
till they are saturated with civilisation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;What is civilisation?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;It is just respect for
property.&nbsp; A state in which no man takes wrongfully what
belongs to another, is a perfectly civilised state.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;Your friend&rsquo;s antiquaries must
have lived in El Dorado, to have had an opportunity of being
saturated with such a state.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;It is a question of degree.&nbsp;
There is more respect for property here than in Angola.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;That depends on the light in which
things are viewed.</p>
<p>Mr. Crotchet was rubbing his hands, in hopes of a fine
discussion, when they came round to the side of the camp where
the picturesque gentleman was sketching.&nbsp; The stranger was
rising up, when Mr. Crotchet begged him not to disturb himself,
and presently walked away with his two guests.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Miss Crotchet and Lady Clarinda, who had
breakfasted by themselves, made their appearance at the same
spot, hanging each on an arm of Lord Bossnowl, who very much
preferred their company to that of the philosophers, though he
would have preferred the company of the latter, or any company to
his own.&nbsp; He thought it very singular that so agreeable a
person as he held himself to be to others, should be so
exceedingly tiresome to himself: he did not attempt to
investigate the cause of this phenomenon, but was contented with
acting on his knowledge of the fact, and giving himself as little
of his own private society as possible.</p>
<p>The stranger rose as they approached, and was immediately
recognised by the Bossnowls as an old acquaintance, and saluted
with the exclamation of &ldquo;Captain Fitzchrome!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The interchange of salutations between Lady Clarinda and the
Captain was accompanied with an amiable confusion on both sides,
in which the observant eyes of Miss Crotchet seemed to read the
recollection of an affair of the heart.</p>
<p>Lord Bossnowl was either unconscious of any such affair, or
indifferent to its existence.&nbsp; He introduced the Captain
very cordially to Miss Crotchet; and the young lady invited him,
as the friend of their guests, to partake of her father&rsquo;s
hospitality, an offer which was readily accepted.</p>
<p>The Captain took his portfolio under his right arm, his camp
stool in his right hand, offered his left arm to Lady Clarinda,
and followed at a reasonable distance behind Miss Crotchet and
Lord Bossnowl, contriving, in the most natural manner possible,
to drop more and more into the rear.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;I am glad to see you can make
yourself so happy with drawing old trees and mounds of grass.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Happy, Lady Clarinda! oh,
no!&nbsp; How can I be happy when I see the idol of my heart
about to be sacrificed on the shrine of Mammon?</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Do you know, though Mammon has a
sort of ill name, I really think he is a very popular character;
there must be at the bottom something amiable about him.&nbsp; He
is certainly one of those pleasant creatures whom everybody
abuses, but without whom no evening party is endurable.&nbsp; I
dare say, love in a cottage is very pleasant; but then it
positively must be a cottage orn&eacute;e: but would not the same
love be a great deal safer in a castle, even if Mammon furnished
the fortification?</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Oh, Lady Clarinda! there is a
heartlessness in that language that chills me to the soul.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Heartlessness!&nbsp; No: my heart
is on my lips.&nbsp; I speak just what I think.&nbsp; You used to
like it, and say it was as delightful as it was rare.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;True, but you did not then
talk as you do now, of love in a castle.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Well, but only consider: a dun is
a horridly vulgar creature; it is a creature I cannot endure the
thought of: and a cottage lets him in so easily.&nbsp; Now a
castle keeps him at bay.&nbsp; You are a half-pay officer, and
are at leisure to command the garrison: but where is the castle?
and who is to furnish the commissariat?</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Is it come to this, that you
make a jest of my poverty?&nbsp; Yet is my poverty only
comparative.&nbsp; Many decent families are maintained on smaller
means.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Decent families: ay, decent is the
distinction from respectable.&nbsp; Respectable means rich, and
decent means poor.&nbsp; I should die if I heard my family called
decent.&nbsp; And then your decent family always lives in a snug
little place: I hate a little place; I like large rooms and large
looking-glasses, and large parties, and a fine large butler, with
a tinge of smooth red in his face; an outward and visible sign
that the family he serves is respectable; if not noble, highly
respectable.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;I cannot believe that you say
all this in earnest.&nbsp; No man is less disposed than I am to
deny the importance of the substantial comforts of life.&nbsp; I
once flattered myself that in our estimate of these things we
were nearly of a mind.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Do you know, I think an opera-box
a very substantial comfort, and a carriage.&nbsp; You will tell
me that many decent people walk arm-in-arm through the snow, and
sit in clogs and bonnets in the pit at the English theatre.&nbsp;
No doubt it is very pleasant to those who are used to it; but it
is not to my taste.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;You always delighted in
trying to provoke me; but I cannot believe that you have not a
heart.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;You do not like to believe that I
have a heart, you mean.&nbsp; You wish to think I have lost it,
and you know to whom; and when I tell you that it is still safe
in my own keeping, and that I do not mean to give it away, the
unreasonable creature grows angry.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Angry! far from it; I am
perfectly cool.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Why, you are pursing your brows,
biting your lips, and lifting up your foot as if you would stamp
it into the earth.&nbsp; I must say anger becomes you; you would
make a charming Hotspur.&nbsp; Your every-day-dining-out face is
rather insipid: but I assure you my heart is in danger when you
are in the heroics.&nbsp; It is so rare, too, in these days of
smooth manners, to see anything like natural expression in a
man&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; There is one set form for every
man&rsquo;s face in female society: a sort of serious comedy
walking gentleman&rsquo;s face: but the moment the creature falls
in love he begins to give himself airs, and plays off all the
varieties of his physiognomy from the Master Slender to the
Petruchio; and then he is actually very amusing.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Well, Lady Clarinda, I will
not be angry, amusing as it may be to you: I listen more in
sorrow than in anger.&nbsp; I half believe you in earnest: and
mourn as over a fallen angel.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;What, because I have made up my
mind not to give away my heart when I can sell it?&nbsp; I will
introduce you to my new acquaintance, Mr. Mac Quedy: he will talk
to you by the hour about exchangeable value, and show you that no
rational being will part with anything, except to the highest
bidder.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Now, I am sure you are not in
earnest.&nbsp; You cannot adopt such sentiments in their naked
deformity.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Naked deformity!&nbsp; Why, Mr.
Mac Quedy will prove to you that they are the cream of the most
refined philosophy.&nbsp; You live a very pleasant life as a
bachelor, roving about the country with your portfolio under your
arm.&nbsp; I am not fit to be a poor man&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; I
cannot take any kind of trouble, or do any one thing that is of
any use.&nbsp; Many decent families roast a bit of mutton on a
string; but if I displease my father I shall not have as much as
will buy the string, to say nothing of the meat; and the bare
idea of such cookery gives me the horrors.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>By this time they were near the Castle, and met Miss Crotchet
and her companion, who had turned back to meet them.&nbsp;
Captain Fitzchrome was shortly after heartily welcomed by Mr.
Crotchet, and the party separated to dress for dinner, the
Captain being by no means in an enviable state of mind, and full
of misgivings as to the extent of belief that he was bound to
accord to the words of the lady of his heart.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PARTY.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>En quoi cognoissez-vous la folie anticque?&nbsp;
En quoi cognoissez-vous la sagesse pr&eacute;sente?&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rabelais</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">If</span> I were sketching a bandit
who had just shot his last pursuer, having outrun all the rest,
that is the very face I would give him,&rdquo; soliloquised the
Captain, as he studied the features of his rival in the
drawing-room, during the miserable half-hour before dinner, when
dulness reigns predominant over expectant company, especially
when they are waiting for some one last comer, whom they all
heartily curse in their hearts, and whom, nevertheless, or indeed
therefore-the-more, they welcome as a sinner, more heartily than
all the just persons who had been punctual to their
engagement.&nbsp; Some new visitors had arrived in the morning,
and, as the company dropped in one by one, the Captain anxiously
watched the unclosing door for the form of his beloved: but she
was the last to make her appearance, and on her entry gave him a
malicious glance, which he construed into a telegraphic
communication that she had stayed away to torment him.&nbsp;
Young Crotchet escorted her with marked attention to the upper
end of the drawing-room, where a great portion of the company was
congregated around Miss Crotchet.&nbsp; These being the only
ladies in the company, it was evident that old Mr. Crotchet would
give his arm to Lady Clarinda, an arrangement with which the
Captain could not interfere.&nbsp; He therefore took his station
near the door, studying his rival from a distance, and determined
to take advantage of his present position, to secure the seat
next to his charmer.&nbsp; He was meditating on the best mode of
operation for securing this important post with due regard to
<i>bien-s&eacute;ance</i>, when he was twitched by the button by
Mr. Mac Quedy, who said to him: &ldquo;Lady Clarinda tells me,
sir, that you are anxious to talk with me on the subject of
exchangeable value, from which I infer that you have studied
political economy, and as a great deal depends on the definition
of value, I shall be glad to set you right on that
point.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am much obliged to you, sir,&rdquo;
said the Captain, and was about to express his utter
disqualification for the proposed instruction, when Mr. Skionar
walked up and said: &ldquo;Lady Clarinda informs me that you wish
to talk over with me the question of subjective reality.&nbsp; I
am delighted to fall in with a gentleman who daily appreciates
the transcendental philosophy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady Clarinda
is too good,&rdquo; said the Captain; and was about to protest
that he had never heard the word &ldquo;transcendental&rdquo;
before, when the butler announced dinner.&nbsp; Mr. Crotchet led
the way with Lady Clarinda: Lord Bossnowl followed with Miss
Crotchet: the economist and transcendentalist pinned in the
Captain, and held him, one by each arm, as he impatiently
descended the stairs in the rear of several others of the
company, whom they had forced him to let pass; but the moment he
entered the dining-room he broke loose from them, and at the
expense of a little <i>brusquerie</i>, secured his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Captain,&rdquo; said Lady Clarinda, &ldquo;I
perceive you can still man&oelig;uvre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could possess you,&rdquo; said the Captain,
&ldquo;to send two unendurable and inconceivable bores to
intercept me with rubbish about which I neither know nor care any
more than the man in the moon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Lady Clarinda, &ldquo;I saw your
design, and wished to put your generalship to the test.&nbsp; But
do not contradict anything I have said about you, and see if the
learned will find you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is fine music, as Rabelais observes, in the
<i>cliquetis d&rsquo;asssiettes</i>, a refreshing shade in the
<i>ombre de salle &agrave; manger</i>, and an elegant fragrance
in the <i>fum&eacute;e de r&ocirc;ti</i>,&rdquo; said a voice at
the Captain&rsquo;s elbow.&nbsp; The Captain turning round,
recognised his clerical friend of the morning, who knew him again
immediately, and said he was extremely glad to meet him there;
more especially as Lady Clarinda had assured him that he was an
enthusiastic lover of Greek poetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Clarinda,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;is a
very pleasant young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;So she is, sir: and I
understand she has all the wit of the family to herself, whatever
that <i>totum</i> may be.&nbsp; But a glass of wine after soup
is, as the French say, the <i>verre de sant&eacute;</i>.&nbsp;
The current of opinion sets in favour of Hock: but I am for
Madeira; I do not fancy Hock till I have laid a substratum of
Madeira.&nbsp; Will you join me?</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;With pleasure.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Here is a very fine salmon
before me: and May is the very <i>point nomm&eacute;</i> to have
salmon in perfection.&nbsp; There is a fine turbot close by, and
there is much to be said in his behalf: but salmon in May is the
king of fish.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;That salmon before you, doctor, was
caught in the Thames, this morning.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr.
Folliott</i>.&mdash;&Pi;&alpha;&pi;&alpha;&pi;&alpha;&#8150;!&nbsp;
Rarity of rarities!&nbsp; A Thames salmon caught this
morning.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Mac Quedy, even in fish your Modern
Athens must yield.&nbsp; <i>Cedite Graii</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Eh! sir, on its own around, your
Thames salmon has two virtues over all others; first, that it is
fresh; and, second, that it is rare; for I understand you do not
take half a dozen in a year.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;In some years, sir, not
one.&nbsp; Mud, filth, gas-dregs, lock-weirs, and the march of
mind, developed in the form of poaching, have ruined the
fishery.&nbsp; But, when we do catch a salmon, happy the man to
whom he falls.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;I confess, sir, this is excellent:
but I cannot see why it should be better than a Tweed salmon at
Kelso.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, I will take a glass
of Hock with you.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;With all my heart, sir.&nbsp;
There are several varieties of the salmon genus: but the common
salmon, the <i>salmo salar</i>, is only one species, one and the
same everywhere, just like the human mind.&nbsp; Locality and
education make all the difference.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Education!&nbsp; Well,
sir, I have no doubt schools for all are just as fit for the
species <i>salmo salar</i> as for the genus <i>homo</i>.&nbsp;
But you must allow that the specimen before us has finished his
education in a manner that does honour to his college.&nbsp;
However, I doubt that the <i>salmo salar</i> is only one species,
that is to say, precisely alike in all localities.&nbsp; I hold
that every river has its own breed, with essential differences;
in flavour especially.&nbsp; And as for the human mind, I deny
that it is the same in all men.&nbsp; I hold that there is every
variety of natural capacity from the idiot to Newton and
Shakespeare; the mass of mankind, midway between these extremes,
being blockheads of different degrees; education leaving them
pretty nearly as it found them, with this single difference, that
it gives a fixed direction to their stupidity, a sort of
incurable wry neck to the thing they call their
understanding.&nbsp; So one nose points always east, and another
always west, and each is ready to swear that it points due
north.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;If that be the point of truth, very
few intellectual noses point due north.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Only those that point to the
Modern Athens.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Where all native noses
point southward.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Eh, sir, northward for wisdom, and
southward for profit.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>, <i>jun.</i>&nbsp; Champagne, doctor?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Most willingly.&nbsp; But
you will permit my drinking it while it sparkles.&nbsp; I hold it
a heresy to let it deaden in my hand, while the glass of my
<i>compotator</i> is being filled on the opposite side of the
table.&nbsp; By-the-bye, Captain, you remember a passage in
Athen&aelig;us, where he cites Menander on the subject of
fish-sauce: &#8000;&psi;&#8049;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;
&#7952;&pi;&#8054;
&#7984;&chi;&theta;&#973;&omicron;&sigmaf;.&nbsp; (The Captain
was aghast for an answer that would satisfy both his neighbours,
when he was relieved by the divine continuing.)&nbsp; The science
of fish-sauce, Mr. Mac Quedy, is by no means brought to
perfection; a fine field of discovery still lies open in that
line.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Nay, sir, beyond lobster-sauce, I
take it, ye cannot go.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;In their line, I grant
you, oyster and lobster-sauce are the pillars of Hercules.&nbsp;
But I speak of the cruet sauces, where the quintessence of the
sapid is condensed in a phial.&nbsp; I can taste in my
mind&rsquo;s palate a combination, which, if I could give it
reality, I would christen with the name of my college, and hand
it down to posterity as a seat of learning indeed.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, I wish you success, but
I cannot let slip the question we started just now.&nbsp; I say,
cutting off idiots, who have no minds at all, all minds are by
nature alike.&nbsp; Education (which begins from their birth)
makes them what they are.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No, sir, it makes their
tendencies, not their power.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar would have been
the first wrestler on the village common.&nbsp; Education might
have made him a Nadir Shah; it might also have made him a
Washington; it could not have made him a merry-andrew, for our
newspapers to extol as a model of eloquence.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Now, sir, I think education would
have made him just anything, and fit for any station, from the
throne to the stocks; saint or sinner, aristocrat or democrat,
judge, counsel, or prisoner at the bar.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I will thank you for a
slice of lamb, with lemon and pepper.&nbsp; Before I proceed with
this discussion,&mdash;Vin de Grave, Mr. Skionar,&mdash;I must
interpose one remark.&nbsp; There is a set of persons in your
city, Mr. Mac Quedy, who concoct, every three or four months, a
thing, which they call a review: a sort of sugar-plum
manufacturers to the Whig aristocracy.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;I cannot tell, sir, exactly, what
you mean by that; but I hope you will speak of those gentlemen
with respect, seeing that I am one of them.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, I must drown my
inadvertence in a glass of Sauterne with you.&nbsp; There is a
set of gentlemen in your city&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Not in our city, exactly; neither
are they a set.&nbsp; There is an editor, who forages for
articles in all quarters, from John o&rsquo; Groat&rsquo;s house
to the Land&rsquo;s End.&nbsp; It is not a board, or a society:
it is a mere intellectual bazaar, where A, B, and C, bring their
wares to market.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, these gentlemen
among them, the present company excepted, have practised as much
dishonesty as, in any other department than literature, would
have brought the practitioner under the cognisance of the
police.&nbsp; In politics, they have ran with the hare and hunted
with the hound.&nbsp; In criticism, they have, knowingly and
unblushingly, given false characters, both for good and for evil;
sticking at no art of misrepresentation, to clear out of the
field of literature all who stood in the way of the interests of
their own clique.&nbsp; They have never allowed their own
profound ignorance of anything (Greek for instance) to throw even
an air of hesitation into their oracular decision on the
matter.&nbsp; They set an example of profligate contempt for
truth, of which the success was in proportion to the effrontery;
and when their prosperity had filled the market with competitors,
they cried out against their own reflected sin, as if they had
never committed it, or were entitled to a monopoly of it.&nbsp;
The latter, I rather think, was what they wanted.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Hermitage, doctor?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Nothing better, sir.&nbsp;
The father who first chose the solitude of that vineyard, knew
well how to cultivate his spirit in retirement.&nbsp; Now, Mr.
Mac Quedy, Achilles was distinguished above all the Greeks for
his inflexible love of truth; could education have made Achilles
one of your reviewers?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;No doubt of it, even if your
character of them were true to the letter.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;And I say,
sir&mdash;chicken and asparagus&mdash;Titan had made him of
better clay.&nbsp; I hold with Pindar, &ldquo;All that is most
excellent is so by nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; &Tau;&#8056;
&delta;&#8050; &phi;&upsilon;&#8119;
&kappa;&rho;&#8049;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&nu;
&#7941;&pi;&alpha;&nu;.&nbsp; Education can give purposes, but
not powers; and whatever purposes had been given him, he would
have gone straight forward to them; straight forward, Mr. Mac
Quedy.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;No, sir, education makes the man,
powers, purposes, and all.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;There is the point, sir,
on which we join issue.</p>
<p>Several others of the company now chimed in with their
opinions, which gave the divine an opportunity to degustate one
or two side dishes, and to take a glass of wine with each of the
young ladies.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHARACTERS.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>Ay imput&eacute; a honte plus que m&eacute;diocre

chevalereux personnaiges.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

</blockquote>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i> (<i>to the Captain</i>).&mdash;I declare
the creature has been listening to all this rigmarole, instead of
attending to me.&nbsp; Do you ever expect forgiveness?&nbsp; But
now that they are all talking together, and you cannot make out a
word they say, nor they hear a word that we say, I will describe
the company to you.&nbsp; First, there is the old gentleman on my
left hand, at the head of the table, who is now leaning the other
way to talk to my brother.&nbsp; He is a good-tempered,
half-informed person, very unreasonably fond of reasoning, and of
reasoning people; people that talk nonsense logically: he is fond
of disputation himself, when there are only one or two, but
seldom does more than listen in a large company of
<i>illumin&eacute;s</i>.&nbsp; He made a great fortune in the
city, and has the comfort of a good conscience.&nbsp; He is very
hospitable, and is generous in dinners; though nothing would
induce him to give sixpence to the poor, because he holds that
all misfortune is from imprudence, that none but the rich ought
to marry, and that all ought to thrive by honest industry, as he
did.&nbsp; He is ambitious of founding a family, and of allying
himself with nobility; and is thus as willing as other grown
children to throw away thousands for a gew-gaw, though he would
not part with a penny for charity.&nbsp; Next to him is my
brother, whom you know as well as I do.&nbsp; He has finished his
education with credit, and as he never ventures to oppose me in
anything, I have no doubt he is very sensible.&nbsp; He has good
manners, is a model of dress, and is reckoned ornamental in all
societies.&nbsp; Next to him is Miss Crotchet, my sister-in-law
that is to be.&nbsp; You see she is rather pretty, and very
genteel.&nbsp; She is tolerably accomplished, has her table
always covered with new novels, thinks Mr. Mac Quedy an oracle,
and is extremely desirous to be called &ldquo;my
lady.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next to her is Mr. Firedamp, a very absurd
person, who thinks that water is the evil principle.&nbsp; Next
to him is Mr. Eavesdrop, a man who, by dint of a certain
something like smartness, has got into good society.&nbsp; He is
a sort of bookseller&rsquo;s tool, and coins all his acquaintance
in reminiscences and sketches of character.&nbsp; I am very shy
of him, for fear he should print me.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;If he print you in your own
likeness, which is that of an angel, you need not fear him.&nbsp;
If he print you in any other, I will cut his throat.&nbsp; But
proceed&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Next to him is Mr. Henbane, the
toxicologist, I think he calls himself.&nbsp; He has passed half
his life in studying poisons and antidotes.&nbsp; The first thing
he did on his arrival here was to kill the cat; and while Miss
Crotchet was crying over her, he brought her to life again.&nbsp;
I am more shy of him than the other.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;They are two very dangerous
fellows, and I shall take care to keep them both at a respectful
distance.&nbsp; Let us hope that Eavesdrop will sketch off
Henbane, and that Henbane will poison him for his trouble.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Well, next to him sits Mr. Mac
Quedy, the Modern Athenian, who lays down the law about
everything, and therefore may be taken to understand
everything.&nbsp; He turns all the affairs of this world into
questions of buying and selling.&nbsp; He is the Spirit of the
Frozen Ocean to everything like romance and sentiment.&nbsp; He
condenses their volume of steam into a drop of cold water in a
moment.&nbsp; He has satisfied me that I am a commodity in the
market, and that I ought to set myself at a high price.&nbsp; So
you see, he who would have me must bid for me.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;I shall discuss that point
with Mr. Mac Quedy.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Not a word for your life.&nbsp;
Our flirtation is our own secret.&nbsp; Let it remain so.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Flirtation, Clarinda!&nbsp;
Is that all that the most ardent&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Now, don&rsquo;t be rhapsodical
here.&nbsp; Next to Mr. Mac Quedy is Mr. Skionar, a sort of
poetical philosopher, a curious compound of the intense and the
mystical.&nbsp; He abominates all the ideas of Mr. Mac Quedy, and
settles everything by sentiment and intuition.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Then, I say, he is the wiser
man.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;They are two oddities, but a
little of them is amusing, and I like to hear them dispute.&nbsp;
So you see I am in training for a philosopher myself.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Any philosophy, for
Heaven&rsquo;s sake, but the pound-shilling-and-pence philosophy
of Mr. Mac Quedy.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Why, they say that even Mr.
Skionar, though he is a great dreamer, always dreams with his
eyes open, or with one eye at any rate, which is an eye to his
gain: but I believe that in this respect the poor man has got an
ill name by keeping bad company.&nbsp; He has two dear friends,
Mr. Wilful Wontsee, and Mr. Rumblesack Shantsee, poets of some
note, who used to see visions of Utopia, and pure republics
beyond the Western deep: but, finding that these El Dorados
brought them no revenue, they turned their vision-seeing faculty
into the more profitable channel of espying all sorts of virtues
in the high and the mighty, who were able and willing to pay for
the discovery.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;I do not fancy these
virtue-spyers.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Next to Mr. Skionar sits Mr.
Chainmail, a good-looking young gentleman, as you see, with very
antiquated tastes.&nbsp; He is fond of old poetry, and is
something of a poet himself.&nbsp; He is deep in monkish
literature, and holds that the best state of society was that of
the twelfth century, when nothing was going forward but fighting,
feasting, and praying, which he says are the three great purposes
for which man was made.&nbsp; He laments bitterly over the
inventions of gunpowder, steam, and gas, which he says have
ruined the world.&nbsp; He lives within two or three miles, and
has a large hall, adorned with rusty pikes, shields, helmets,
swords, and tattered banners, and furnished with yew-tree chairs,
and two long old worm-eaten oak tables, where he dines with all
his household, after the fashion of his favourite age.&nbsp; He
wants us all to dine with him, and I believe we shall go.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;That will be something new,
at any rate.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Next to him is Mr. Toogood, the
co-operationist, who will have neither fighting nor praying; but
wants to parcel out the world into squares like a chess-board,
with a community on each, raising everything for one another,
with a great steam-engine to serve them in common for tailor and
hosier, kitchen and cook.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;He is the strangest of the
set, so far.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;This brings us to the bottom of
the table, where sits my humble servant, Mr. Crotchet the
younger.&nbsp; I ought not to describe him.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;I entreat you do.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Well, I really have very little to
say in his favour.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;I do not wish to hear
anything in his favour; and I rejoice to hear you say so,
because&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Do not flatter yourself.&nbsp; If
I take him, it will be to please my father, and to have a town
and country house, and plenty of servants and a carriage and an
opera-box, and make some of my acquaintance who have married for
love, or for rank, or for anything but money, die for envy of my
jewels.&nbsp; You do not think I would take him for
himself.&nbsp; Why, he is very smooth and spruce as far as his
dress goes; but as to his face, he looks as if he had tumbled
headlong into a volcano, and been thrown up again among the
cinders.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;I cannot believe, that,
speaking thus of him, you mean to take him at all.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Oh! I am out of my teens.&nbsp; I
have been very much in love; but now I am come to years of
discretion, and must think, like other people, of settling myself
advantageously.&nbsp; He was in love with a banker&rsquo;s
daughter, and cast her off at her father&rsquo;s bankruptcy, and
the poor girl has gone to hide herself in some wild place.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;She must have a strange
taste, if she pines for the loss of him.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;They say he was good-looking, till
his bubble schemes, as they call them, stamped him with the
physiognomy of a desperate gambler.&nbsp; I suspect he has still
a penchant towards his first flame.&nbsp; If he takes me, it will
be for my rank and connection, and the second seat of the borough
of Rogueingrain.&nbsp; So we shall meet on equal terms, and shall
enjoy all the blessedness of expecting nothing from each
other.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;You can expect no security
with such an adventurer.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;I shall have the security of a
good settlement, and then if <i>andare al diavolo</i> be his
destiny, he may go, you know, by himself.&nbsp; He is almost
always dreaming and <i>distrait</i>.&nbsp; It is very likely that
some great reverse is in store for him: but that will not concern
me, you perceive.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;You torture me, Clarinda,
with the bare possibility.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Hush!&nbsp; Here is music to
soothe your troubled spirit.&nbsp; Next to him, on this side,
sits the dilettante composer, Mr. Trillo; they say his name was
O&rsquo;Trill, and he has taken the O from the beginning, and put
it at the end.&nbsp; I do not know how this may be.&nbsp; He
plays well on the violoncello, and better on the piano; sings
agreeably; has a talent at versemaking, and improvises a song
with some felicity.&nbsp; He is very agreeable company in the
evening, with his instruments and music-books.&nbsp; He maintains
that the sole end of all enlightened society is to get up a good
opera, and laments that wealth, genius, and energy are squandered
upon other pursuits, to the neglect of this one great matter.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;That is a very pleasant fancy
at any rate.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;I assure you he has a great deal
to say for it.&nbsp; Well, next to him, again, is Dr. Morbific,
who has been all over the world to prove that there is no such
thing as contagion; and has inoculated himself with plague,
yellow fever, and every variety of pestilence, and is still alive
to tell the story.&nbsp; I am very shy of him, too; for I look on
him as a walking phial of wrath, corked full of all infections,
and not to be touched without extreme hazard.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;This is the strangest fellow
of all.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Next to him sits Mr. Philpot, the
geographer, who thinks of nothing but the heads and tails of
rivers, and lays down the streams of Terra Incognita as
accurately as if he had been there.&nbsp; He is a person of
pleasant fancy, and makes a sort of fairy land of every country
he touches, from the Frozen Ocean to the Deserts of Sahara.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;How does he settle matters
with Mr. Firedamp?</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;You see Mr. Firedamp has got as
far as possible out of his way.&nbsp; Next to him is Sir Simon
Steeltrap, of Steeltrap Lodge, Member for Crouching-Curtown,
Justice of Peace for the county, and Lord of the United Manors of
Spring-gun-and-Treadmill; a great preserver of game and public
morals.&nbsp; By administering the laws which he assists in
making, he disposes, at his pleasure, of the land and its live
stock, including all the two-legged varieties, with and without
feathers, in a circumference of several miles round Steeltrap
Lodge.&nbsp; He has enclosed commons and woodlands; abolished
cottage gardens; taken the village cricket-ground into his own
park, out of pure regard to the sanctity of Sunday; shut up
footpaths and alehouses (all but those which belong to his
electioneering friend, Mr. Quassia, the brewer); put down fairs
and fiddlers; committed many poachers; shot a few; convicted
one-third of the peasantry; suspected the rest; and passed nearly
the whole of them through a wholesome course of prison
discipline, which has finished their education at the expense of
the county.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;He is somewhat out of his
element here: among such a diversity of opinions he will hear
some he will not like.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;It was rather ill-judged in Mr.
Crotchet to invite him to-day.&nbsp; But the art of assorting
company is above these <i>parvenus</i>.&nbsp; They invite a
certain number of persons without considering how they harmonise
with each other.&nbsp; Between Sir Simon and you is the Reverend
Doctor Folliott.&nbsp; He is said to be an excellent scholar, and
is fonder of books than the majority of his cloth; he is very
fond, also, of the good things of this world.&nbsp; He is of an
admirable temper, and says rude things in a pleasant half-earnest
manner, that nobody can take offence with.&nbsp; And next to him
again is one Captain Fitzchrome, who is very much in love with a
certain person that does not mean to have anything to say to him,
because she can better her fortune by taking somebody else.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;And next to him again is the
beautiful, the accomplished, the witty, the fascinating, the
tormenting, Lady Clarinda, who traduces herself to the said
Captain by assertions which it would drive him crazy to
believe.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Time will show, sir.&nbsp; And now
we have gone the round of the table.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;But I must say, though I know
you had always a turn for sketching characters, you surprise me
by your observation, and especially by your attention to
opinions.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Well, I will tell you a secret: I
am writing a novel.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;A novel!</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Yes, a novel.&nbsp; And I shall
get a little finery by it: trinkets and fal-lals, which I cannot
get from papa.&nbsp; You must know I have been reading several
fashionable novels, the fashionable this, and the fashionable
that; and I thought to myself, why I can do better than any of
these myself.&nbsp; So I wrote a chapter or two, and sent them as
a specimen to Mr. Puffall, the book-seller, telling him they were
to be a part of the fashionable something or other, and he
offered me, I will not say how much, to finish it in three
volumes, and let him pay all the newspapers for recommending it
as the work of a lady of quality, who had made very free with the
characters of her acquaintance.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Surely you have not done
so?</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Oh, no!&nbsp; I leave that to Mr.
Eavesdrop.&nbsp; But Mr. Puffall made it a condition that I
should let him say so.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;A strange recommendation.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Oh, nothing else will do.&nbsp;
And it seems you may give yourself any character you like, and
the newspapers will print it as if it came from themselves.&nbsp;
I have commended you to three of our friends here as an
economist, a transcendentalist, and a classical scholar; and if
you wish to be renowned through the world for these, or any other
accomplishments, the newspapers will confirm you in their
possession for half-a-guinea a piece.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Truly, the praise of such
gentry must be a feather in any one&rsquo;s cap.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;So you will see, some morning,
that my novel is &ldquo;the most popular production of the
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is Mr. Puffall&rsquo;s favourite
phrase.&nbsp; He makes the newspapers say it of everything he
publishes.&nbsp; But &ldquo;the day,&rdquo; you know, is a very
convenient phrase; it allows of three hundred and sixty-five
&ldquo;most popular productions&rdquo; in a year.&nbsp; And in
leap-year one more.</p>

Not one could fit the other&rsquo;s noddle.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Butler</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, the last course, and the
dessert, passed by.&nbsp; When the ladies had withdrawn, young
Crotchet addressed the company.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>, <i>jun.</i>&nbsp; There is one point in
which philosophers of all classes seem to be agreed: that they
only want money to regenerate the world.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;No doubt of it.&nbsp; Nothing is
so easy as to lay down the outlines of perfect society.&nbsp;
There wants nothing but money to set it going.&nbsp; I will
explain myself clearly and fully by reading a paper.&nbsp;
(Producing a large scroll.)&nbsp; &ldquo;In the infancy of
society&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Pray, Mr. Mac Quedy, how
is it that all gentlemen of your nation begin everything they
write with the &ldquo;infancy of society?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Eh, sir, it is the simplest way to
begin at the beginning.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the infancy of society,
when government was invented to save a percentage; say two and a
half per cent.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I will not say any such
thing.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Well, say any percentage you
please.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I will not say any
percentage at all.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;On the principle of the
division of labour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Government was invented to
spend a percentage.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;To save a percentage.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No, sir, to spend a
percentage; and a good deal more than two and a half
percent.&nbsp; Two hundred and fifty per cent.: that is
intelligible.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;In the infancy of
society&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Toogood</i>.&mdash;Never mind the infancy of
society.&nbsp; The question is of society in its maturity.&nbsp;
Here is what it should be.&nbsp; (Producing a paper.)&nbsp; I
have laid it down in a diagram.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;Before we proceed to the question of
government, we must nicely discriminate the boundaries of sense,
understanding, and reason.&nbsp; Sense is a
receptivity&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>, <i>jun.</i>&mdash;We are proceeding too
fast.&nbsp; Money being all that is wanted to regenerate society,
I will put into the hands of this company a large sum for the
purpose.&nbsp; Now let us see how to dispose of it.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;We will begin by taking a
committee-room in London, where we will dine together once a
week, to deliberate.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;If the money is to go in
deliberative dinners, you may set me down for a committee man and
honorary caterer.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Next, you must all learn political
economy, which I will teach you, very compendiously, in lectures
over the bottle.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I hate lectures over the
bottle.&nbsp; But pray, sir, what is political economy?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Political economy is to the state
what domestic economy is to the family.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No such thing, sir.&nbsp;
In the family there is a <i>paterfamilias</i>, who regulates the
distribution, and takes care that there shall be no such thing in
the household as one dying of hunger, while another dies of
surfeit.&nbsp; In the state it is all hunger at one end, and all
surfeit at the other.&nbsp; Matchless claret, Mr. Crotchet.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Vintage of fifteen, Doctor.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;The family consumes, and so does
the state.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Consumes, air!&nbsp; Yes:
but the mode, the proportions: there is the essential difference
between the state and the family.&nbsp; Sir, I hate false
analogies.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, the analogy is not
essential.&nbsp; Distribution will come under its proper
head.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Come where it will, the
distribution of the state is in no respect analogous to the
distribution of the family.&nbsp; The <i>paterfamilias</i>, sir:
the <i>paterfamilias</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, let that pass.&nbsp;
The family consumes, and in order to consume, it must have
supply.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, Adam and Eve
knew that, when they delved and span.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Very true, sir (reproducing his
scroll).&nbsp; &ldquo;In the infancy of society&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Toogood</i>.&mdash;The reverend gentleman has hit the
nail on the head.&nbsp; It is the distribution that must be
looked to; it is the <i>paterfamilias</i> that is wanting in the
State.&nbsp; Now here I have provided him.&nbsp; (Reproducing his
diagram.)</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;Apply the money, sir, to building and
endowing an opera house, where the ancient altar of Bacchus may
flourish, and justice may be done to sublime compositions.&nbsp;
(Producing a part of a manuscript opera.)</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;No, sir, build <i>sacella</i> for
transcendental oracles to teach the world how to see through a
glass darkly.&nbsp; (Producing a scroll.)</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;See through an opera-glass
brightly.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;See through a wine-glass
full of claret; then you see both darkly and brightly.&nbsp; But,
gentlemen, if you are all in the humour for reading papers, I
will read you the first half of my next Sunday&rsquo;s
sermon.&nbsp; (Producing a paper.)</p>
<p><i>Omnes</i>.&mdash;No sermon!&nbsp; No sermon!</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Then I move that our
respective papers be committed to our respective pockets.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Political economy is divided into
two great branches, production and consumption.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Yes, sir; there are two
great classes of men: those who produce much and consume little;
and those who consume much and produce nothing.&nbsp; The
<i>fruges consumere nati</i> have the best of it.&nbsp; Eh,
Captain!&nbsp; You remember the characteristics of a great man
according to Aristophanes: &#8005;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;
&gamma;&epsilon; &pi;&#8055;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;
&omicron;&#7990;&delta;&epsilon; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&beta;&#8055;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;
&mu;&#8057;&nu;&omicron;&nu;.&nbsp; Ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; Well,
Captain, even in these tight-laced days, the obscurity of a
learned language allows a little pleasantry.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Very true, sir; the
pleasantry and the obscurity go together; they are all one, as it
were&mdash;to me at any rate (aside).</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Now, sir&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Pray, sir, let your
science alone, or you will put me under the painful necessity of
demolishing it bit by bit, as I have done your exordium.&nbsp; I
will undertake it any morning; but it is too hard exercise after
dinner.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, in the meantime I hold
my science established.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;And I hold it
demolished.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>, <i>jun.</i>&nbsp; Pray, gentlemen, pocket
your manuscripts, fill your glasses, and consider what we shall
do with our money.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Build lecture-rooms, and schools
for all.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;Revive the Athenian theatre;
regenerate the lyrical drama.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Toogood</i>.&mdash;Build a grand co-operative
parallelogram, with a steam-engine in the middle for a maid of
all work.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Firedamp</i>.&mdash;Drain the country, and get rid of
malaria, by abolishing duck-ponds.</p>
<p><i>Dr. Morbific</i>.&mdash;Found a philanthropic college of
anticontagionists, where all the members shall be inoculated with
the virus of all known diseases.&nbsp; Try the experiment on a
grand scale.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Build a great dining-hall; endow
it with beef and ale, and hang the hall round with arms to defend
the provisions.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Henbane</i>.&mdash;Found a toxicological institution
for trying all poisons and antidotes.&nbsp; I myself have killed
a frog twelve times, and brought him to life eleven; but the
twelfth time he died.&nbsp; I have a phial of the drug, which
killed him, in my pocket, and shall not rest till I have
discovered its antidote.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I move that the last
speaker be dispossessed of his phial, and that it be forthwith
thrown into the Thames.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Henbane</i>.&mdash;How, sir? my invaluable, and, in the
present state of human knowledge, infallible poison?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Let the frogs have all the
advantage of it.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Consider, Doctor, the fish might
participate.&nbsp; Think of the salmon.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Then let the owner&rsquo;s
right-hand neighbour swallow it.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Eavesdrop</i>.&mdash;Me, sir!&nbsp; What have I done,
sir, that I am to be poisoned, sir?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, you have published a
character of your facetious friend, the Reverend Doctor F.,
wherein you have sketched off me; me, sir, even to my nose and
wig.&nbsp; What business have the public with my nose and
wig?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Eavesdrop</i>.&mdash;Sir, it is all good-humoured; all
in <i>bonhomie</i>: all friendly and complimentary.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, the bottle, <i>la
Dive Bouteille</i>, is a recondite oracle, which makes an
Eleusinian temple of the circle in which it moves.&nbsp; He who
reveals its mysteries must die.&nbsp; Therefore, let the dose be
administered.&nbsp; <i>Fiat experimentum in anim&acirc;
vili</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Eavesdrop</i>.&mdash;Sir, you are very facetious at my
expense.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, you have been very
unfacetious, very inficete at mine.&nbsp; You have dished me up,
like a savoury omelette, to gratify the appetite of the reading
rabble for gossip.&nbsp; The next time, sir, I will respond with
the <i>argumentum baculinum</i>.&nbsp; Print that, sir: put it on
record as a promise of the Reverend Doctor F., which shall be
most faithfully kept, with an exemplary bamboo.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Eavesdrop</i>.&mdash;Your cloth protects you, sir.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;My bamboo shall protect
me, sir.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Doctor, Doctor, you are growing too
polemical.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, my blood boils.&nbsp;
What business have the public with my nose and wig?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Doctor! Doctor!</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>, <i>jun.</i>&nbsp; Pray, gentlemen, return
to the point.&nbsp; How shall we employ our fund?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Philpot</i>.&mdash;Surely in no way so beneficially as
in exploring rivers.&nbsp; Send a fleet of steamboats down the
Niger, and another up the Nile.&nbsp; So shall you civilise
Africa, and establish stocking factories in Abyssinia and
Bambo.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;With all submission,
breeches and petticoats must precede stockings.&nbsp; Send out a
crew of tailors.&nbsp; Try if the King of Bambo will invest in
inexpressibles.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>, <i>jun.</i>&mdash;Gentlemen, it is not
for partial, but for general benefit, that this fund is proposed:
a grand and universally applicable scheme for the amelioration of
the condition of man.</p>
<p><i>Several Voices</i>.&mdash;That is my scheme.&nbsp; I have
not heard a scheme but my own that has a grain of common
sense.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;Gentlemen, you inspire me.&nbsp; Your
last exclamation runs itself into a chorus, and sets itself to
music.&nbsp; Allow me to lead, and to hope for your voices in
harmony.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful
meditation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And profound deliberation,<br />
On the various pretty projects which have just been shown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a scheme in agitation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the world&rsquo;s
amelioration,<br />
Has a grain of common sense in it, except my own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Several Voices</i>.&mdash;We are not disposed to join in
any such chorus.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Well, of all these
schemes, I am for Mr. Trillo&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Regenerate the
Athenian theatre.&nbsp; My classical friend here, the Captain,
will vote with, me.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;I, sir? oh! of course,
sir.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Surely, Captain, I rely on you to
uphold political economy.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Me, sir! oh, to be sure,
sir.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Pray, sir, will political
economy uphold the Athenian theatre?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Surely not.&nbsp; It would be a
very unproductive investment.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Then the Captain votes
against you.&nbsp; What, sir, did not the Athenians, the wisest
of nations, appropriate to their theatre their most sacred and
intangible fund?&nbsp; Did not they give to melopoeia,
choregraphy, and the sundry forms of didascalics, the precedence
of all other matters, civil and military?&nbsp; Was it not their
law, that even the proposal to divert this fund to any other
purpose should be punished with death?&nbsp; But, sir, I further
propose that the Athenian theatre being resuscitated, the
admission shall be free to all who can expound the Greek
choruses, constructively, mythologically, and metrically, and to
none others.&nbsp; So shall all the world learn Greek: Greek, the
Alpha and Omega of all knowledge.&nbsp; At him who sits not in
the theatre shall be pointed the finger of scorn: he shall be
called in the highway of the city, &ldquo;a fellow without
Greek.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;But the ladies, sir, the ladies.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Every man may take in a
lady: and she who can construe and metricise a chorus, shall, if
she so please, pass in by herself.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;But, sir, you will shut me out of my
own theatre.&nbsp; Let there at least be a double passport, Greek
and Italian.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No, sir; I am
inexorable.&nbsp; No Greek, no theatre.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;Sir, I cannot consent to be shut out
from my own theatre.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;You see how it is, Squire
Crotchet the younger; you can scarcely find two to agree on a
scheme, and no two of those can agree on the details.&nbsp; Keep
your money in your pocket.&nbsp; And so ends the fund for
regenerating the world.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Nay, by no means.&nbsp; We are all
agreed on deliberative dinners.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Very true; we will dine
and discuss.&nbsp; We will sing with Robin Hood, &ldquo;If I
drink water while this doth last;&rdquo; and while it lasts we
will have no adjournment, if not to the Athenian theatre.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;Well, gentlemen, I hope this chorus
at least will please you:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>If I drink water while this doth last,<br />
May I never again drink wine:<br />
For how can a man, in his life of a span,<br />
Do anything better than dine?<br />
We'll dine and drink, and say if we think<br />
That anything better can be,<br />
And when we have dined, wish all mankind<br />
May dine as well as we.<br />
And though a good wish will fill no dish<br />
And brim no cup with sack,<br />
Yet thoughts will spring as the glasses ring,<br />
To illume our studious track.<br />
On the brilliant dreams of our hopeful schemes<br />
The light of the flask shall shine;<br />
And we&rsquo;ll sit till day, but we&rsquo;ll find the way<br />
To drench the world with wine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The schemes for the world&rsquo;s regeneration evaporated in a
tumult of voices.</p>

I ne&rsquo;er saw so profane a show.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Butler</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> library of Crotchet Castle was
a large and well-furnished apartment, opening on one side into an
ante-room, on the other into a music-room.&nbsp; It had several
tables stationed at convenient distances; one consecrated to the
novelties of literature, another to the novelties of
embellishment; others unoccupied, and at the disposal of the
company.&nbsp; The walls were covered with a copious collection
of ancient and modern books; the ancient having been selected and
arranged by the Reverend Doctor Folliott.&nbsp; In the ante-room
were card-tables; in the music-room were various instruments, all
popular operas, and all fashionable music.&nbsp; In this suite of
apartments, and not in the drawing-room, were the evenings of
Crotchet Castle usually passed.</p>
<p>The young ladies were in the music-room; Miss Crotchet at the
piano, Lady Clarinda at the harp, playing and occasionally
singing, at the suggestion of Mr. Trillo, portions of <i>Matilde
di Shabran</i>.&nbsp; Lord Bossnowl was turning over the leaves
for Miss Crotchet; the Captain was performing the same office for
Lady Clarinda, but with so much more attention to the lady than
the book, that he often made sad work with the harmony, by
turnover of two leaves together.&nbsp; On these occasions Miss
Crotchet paused, Lady Clarinda laughed, Mr. Trillo scolded, Lord
Bossnowl yawned, the Captain apologised, and the performance
proceeded.</p>
<p>In the library Mr. Mac Quedy was expounding political economy
to the Reverend Doctor Folliott, who was <i>pro more</i>
demolishing its doctrines <i>seriatim</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Chainmail was in hot dispute with Mr. Skionar, touching
the physical and moral well-being of man.&nbsp; Mr. Skionar was
enforcing his friend Mr. Shantsee&rsquo;s views of moral
discipline; maintaining that the sole thing needful for man in
this world was loyal and pious education; the giving men good
books to read, and enough of the hornbook to read them; with a
judicious interspersion of the lessons of Old Restraint, which
was his poetic name for the parish stocks.&nbsp; Mr. Chainmail,
on the other hand, stood up for the exclusive necessity of beef
and ale, lodging and raiment, wife and children, courage to fight
for them all, and armour wherewith to do so.</p>
<p>Mr. Henbane had got his face scratched, and his finger bitten,
by the cat, in trying to catch her for a second experiment in
killing and bringing to life; and Doctor Morbific was comforting
him with a disquisition to prove that there were only four
animals having the power to communicate hydrophobia, of which the
cat was one; and that it was not necessary that the animal should
be in a rabid state, the nature of the wound being everything,
and the idea of contagion a delusion.&nbsp; Mr. Henbane was
listening very lugubriously to this dissertation.</p>
<p>Mr. Philpot had seized on Mr. Firedamp, and pinned him down to
a map of Africa, on which he was tracing imaginary courses of
mighty inland rivers, terminating in lakes and marshes, where
they were finally evaporated by the heat of the sun; and Mr.
Firedamp&rsquo;s hair was standing on end at the bare imagination
of the mass of malaria that must be engendered by the
operation.&nbsp; Mr. Toogood had begun explaining his diagrams to
Sir Simon Steeltrap; but Sir Simon grew testy, and told Mr.
Toogood that the promulgators of such doctrines ought to be
consigned to the treadmill.&nbsp; The philanthropist walked off
from the country gentleman, and proceeded to hold forth to young
Crotchet, who stood silent, as one who listens, but in reality
without hearing a syllable.&nbsp; Mr. Crotchet, senior, as the
master of the house, was left to entertain himself with his own
meditations, till the Reverend Doctor Folliott tore himself from
Mr. Mac Quedy, and proceeded to expostulate with Mr. Crotchet on
a delicate topic.</p>
<p>There was an Italian painter, who obtained the name of <i>Il
Bragatore</i>, by the superinduction of inexpressibles on the
naked Apollos and Bacchuses of his betters.&nbsp; The fame of
this worthy remained one and indivisible, till a set of heads,
which had been, by a too common mistake of Nature&rsquo;s
journeymen, stuck upon magisterial shoulders, as the Corinthian
capitals of &ldquo;fair round bellies with fat capon
lined,&rdquo; but which Nature herself had intended for the
noddles of porcelain mandarins, promulgated simultaneously from
the east and the west of London, an order that no
plaster-of-Paris Venus should appear in the streets without
petticoats.&nbsp; Mr. Crotchet, on reading this order in the
evening paper, which, by the postman&rsquo;s early arrival, was
always laid on his breakfast-table, determined to fill his house
with Venuses of all sizes and kinds.&nbsp; In pursuance of this
resolution, came packages by water-carriage, containing an
infinite variety of Venuses.&nbsp; There were the Medicean Venus,
and the Bathing Venus; the Uranian Venus, and the Pandemian
Venus; the Crouching Venus, and the Sleeping Venus; the Venus
rising from the sea, the Venus with the apple of Paris, and the
Venus with the armour of Mars.</p>
<p>The Reverend Doctor Folliott had been very much astonished at
this unexpected display.&nbsp; Disposed, as he was, to hold, that
whatever had been in Greece, was right; he was more than doubtful
of the propriety of throwing open the classical <i>adytum</i> to
the illiterate profane.&nbsp; Whether, in his interior mind, he
was at all influenced, either by the consideration that it would
be for the credit of his cloth, with some of his vice-suppressing
neighbours, to be able to say that he had expostulated; or by
curiosity, to try what sort of defence his city-bred friend, who
knew the classics only by translations, and whose reason was
always a little ahead of his knowledge, would make for his
somewhat ostentatious display of liberality in matters of taste;
is a question on which the learned may differ: but, after having
duly deliberated on two full-sized casts of the Uranian and
Pandemian Venus, in niches on each side of the chimney, and on
three alabaster figures, in glass cases, on the mantelpiece, he
proceeded, peirastically, to open his fire.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;These little alabaster
figures on the mantelpiece, Mr. Crotchet, and those large figures
in the niches&mdash;may I take the liberty to ask you what they
are intended to represent?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Venus, sir; nothing more, sir; just
Venus.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;May I ask you, sir, why
they are there?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;To be looked at, sir; just to be
looked at: the reasons for most things in a gentleman&rsquo;s
house being in it at all; from the paper on the walls, and the
drapery of the curtains, even to the books in the library, of
which the most essential part is the appearance of the back.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Very true, sir.&nbsp; As
great philosophers hold that the <i>esse</i> of things is
<i>percipi</i>, so a gentleman&rsquo;s furniture exists to be
looked at.&nbsp; Nevertheless, sir, there are some things more
fit to be looked at than others; for instance, there is nothing
more fit to be looked at than the outside of a book.&nbsp; It is,
as I may say, from repeated experience, a pure and unmixed
pleasure to have a goodly volume lying before you, and to know
that you may open it if you please, and need not open it unless
you please.&nbsp; It is a resource against <i>ennui</i>, if
<i>ennui</i> should come upon you.&nbsp; To have the resource and
not to feel the <i>ennui</i>, to enjoy your bottle in the
present, and your book in the indefinite future, is a delightful
condition of human existence.&nbsp; There is no place, in which a
man can move or sit, in which the outside of a book can be
otherwise than an innocent and becoming spectacle.&nbsp; Touching
this matter, there cannot, I think, be two opinions.&nbsp; But
with respect to your Venuses there can be, and indeed there are,
two very distinct opinions.&nbsp; Now, Sir, that little figure in
the centre of the mantelpiece&mdash;as a grave
<i>paterfamilias</i>, Mr. Crotchet, with a fair nubile daughter,
whose eyes are like the fish-pools of Heshbon&mdash;I would ask
you if you hold that figure to be altogether delicate?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;The sleeping Venus, sir?&nbsp;
Nothing can be more delicate than the entire contour of the
figure, the flow of the hair on the shoulders and neck, the form
of the feet and fingers.&nbsp; It is altogether a most delicate
morsel.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Why, in that sense,
perhaps, it is as delicate as whitebait in July.&nbsp; But the
attitude, sir, the attitude.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Nothing can be more natural,
sir.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;That is the very thing,
sir.&nbsp; It is too natural: too natural, sir: it lies for all
the world like&mdash;&nbsp; I make no doubt, the pious
cheesemonger, who recently broke its plaster facsimile over the
head of the itinerant vendor, was struck by a certain similitude
to the position of his own sleeping beauty, and felt his noble
wrath thereby justly aroused.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Very likely, sir.&nbsp; In my
opinion, the cheesemonger was a fool, and the justice who sided
with him was a greater.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Fool, sir, is a harsh
term: call not thy brother a fool.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Sir, neither the cheesemonger nor
the justice is a brother of mine.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, we are all
brethren.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Yes, sir, as the hangman is of the
thief; the squire of the poacher; the judge of the libeller; the
lawyer of his client; the statesman of his colleague; the
bubble-blower of the bubble-buyer; the slave-driver of the negro;
as these are brethren, so am I and the worthies in question.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;To be sure, sir, in these
instances, and in many others, the term brother must be taken in
its utmost latitude of interpretation: we are all brothers,
nevertheless.&nbsp; But to return to the point.&nbsp; Now these
two large figures, one with drapery on the lower half of the
body, and the other with no drapery at all; upon my word, sir, it
matters not what godfathers and godmothers may have promised and
vowed for the children of this world, touching the devil and
other things to be renounced, if such figures as those are to be
put before their eyes.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Sir, the naked figure is the
Pandemian Venus, and the half-draped figure is the Uranian Venus;
and I say, sir, that figure realises the finest imaginings of
Plato, and is the personification of the most refined and exalted
feeling of which the human mind is susceptible; the love of pure,
ideal, intellectual beauty.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I am aware, sir, that
Plato, in his Symposium, discourseth very eloquently touching the
Uranian and Pandemian Venus: but you must remember that, in our
universities, Plato is held to be little better than a misleader
of youth; and they have shown their contempt for him, not only by
never reading him (a mode of contempt in which they deal very
largely), but even by never printing a complete edition of him;
although they have printed many ancient books, which nobody
suspects to have been ever read on the spot, except by a person
attached to the press, who is, therefore, emphatically called
&ldquo;the reader.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Well, sir?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Why, sir, to &ldquo;the
reader&rdquo; aforesaid (supposing either of our universities to
have printed an edition of Plato), or to any one else who can be
supposed to have read Plato, or, indeed, to be ever likely to do
so, I would very willingly show these figures; because to such
they would, I grant you, be the outward and visible signs of
poetical and philosophical ideas: but, to the multitude, the
gross, carnal multitude, they are but two beautiful women, one
half undressed, and the other quite so.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Then, sir, let the multitude look
upon them and learn modesty.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I must say that, if I
wished my footman to learn modesty, I should not dream of sending
him to school to a naked Venus.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Sir, ancient sculpture is the true
school of modesty.&nbsp; But where the Greeks had modesty, we
have cant; where they had poetry, we have cant; where they had
patriotism, we have cant; where they had anything that exalts,
delights, or adorns humanity, we have nothing but cant, cant,
cant.&nbsp; And, sir, to show my contempt for cant in all its
shapes, I have adorned my house with the Greek Venus, in all her
shapes, and am ready to fight her battle against all the
societies that ever were instituted for the suppression of truth
and beauty.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;My dear sir, I am afraid
you are growing warm.&nbsp; Pray be cool.&nbsp; Nothing
contributes so much to good digestion as to be perfectly cool
after dinner.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Sir, the Laced&aelig;monian virgins
wrestled naked with young men; and they grew up, as the wise
Lycurgus had foreseen, into the most modest of women, and the
most exemplary of wives and mothers.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Very likely, sir; but the
Athenian virgins did no such thing, and they grew up into wives
who stayed at home&mdash;stayed at home, sir; and looked after
their husbands&rsquo; dinner&mdash;his dinner, sir, you will
please to observe.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;And what was the consequence of
that, sir? that they were such very insipid persons that the
husband would not go home to eat his dinner, but preferred the
company of some Aspasia, or Lais.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Two very different
persons, sir, give me leave to remark.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Very likely, sir; but both too good
to be married in Athens.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, Lais was a
Corinthian.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Od&rsquo;s vengeance, sir, some
Aspasia and any other Athenian name of the same sort of person
you like&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I do not like the sort of
person at all: the sort of person I like, as I have already
implied, is a modest woman, who stays at home and looks after her
husband&rsquo;s dinner.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, that was not the taste
of the Athenians.&nbsp; They preferred the society of women who
would not have made any scruple about sitting as models to
Praxiteles; as you know, sir, very modest women in Italy did to
Canova; one of whom, an Italian countess, being asked by an
English lady, &ldquo;how she could bear it?&rdquo; answered,
&ldquo;Very well; there was a good fire in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, the English lady
should have asked how the Italian lady&rsquo;s husband could bear
it.&nbsp; The phials of my wrath would overflow if poor dear Mrs.
Folliott &mdash;: sir, in return for your story, I will tell you
a story of my ancestor, Gilbert Folliott.&nbsp; The devil haunted
him, as he did Saint Francis, in the likeness of a beautiful
damsel; but all he could get from the exemplary Gilbert was an
admonition to wear a stomacher and longer petticoats.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Sir, your story makes for my side
of the question.&nbsp; It proves that the devil, in the likeness
of a fair damsel, with short petticoats and no stomacher, was
almost too much for Gilbert Folliott.&nbsp; The force of the
spell was in the drapery.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Bless my soul, sir!</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Give me leave, sir.&nbsp;
Diderot&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Who was he, sir?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Who was he, sir? the sublime
philosopher, the father of the Encyclop&aelig;dia, of all the
encyclop&aelig;dias that have ever been printed.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Bless me, sir, a terrible
progeny: they belong to the tribe of Incubi.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;The great philosopher,
Diderot&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, Diderot is not a man
after my heart.&nbsp; Keep to the Greeks, if you please; albeit
this Sleeping Venus is not an antique.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, the Greeks: why do we
call the Elgin marbles inestimable?&nbsp; Simply because they are
true to nature.&nbsp; And why are they so superior in that point
to all modern works, with all our greater knowledge of
anatomy?&nbsp; Why, sir, but because the Greeks, having no cant,
had better opportunities of studying models?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, I deny our greater
knowledge of anatomy.&nbsp; But I shall take the liberty to
employ, on this occasion, the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>.&nbsp;
Would you have allowed Miss Crotchet to sit for a model to
Canova?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Yes, sir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the Reverend
Doctor Folliott, throwing himself back into a chair, and flinging
up his heels, with the premeditated design of giving emphasis to
his exclamation; but by miscalculating his impetus, he
overbalanced his chair, and laid himself on the carpet in a right
angle, of which his back was the base.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SCIENCE AND CHARITY.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>Chi sta nel mondo un par d&rsquo;ore contento,<br

N&egrave; gli vien tolta, ovver contaminata,<br />
Quella sua pace in veruno momento,<br />
Puo dir che Giove drittamente il guata.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Reverend Doctor Folliott took
his departure about ten o&rsquo;clock, to walk home to his
vicarage.&nbsp; There was no moon, but the night was bright and
clear, and afforded him as much light as he needed.&nbsp; He
paused a moment by the Roman camp to listen to the nightingale;
repeated to himself a passage of Sophocles; proceeded through the
park gate, and entered the narrow lane that led to the
village.&nbsp; He walked on in a very pleasant mood of the state
called reverie; in which fish and wine, Greek and political
economy, the Sleeping Venus he had left behind, and poor dear
Mrs. Folliott, to whose fond arms he was returning, passed, as in
a camera obscura, over the tablets of his imagination.&nbsp;
Presently the image of Mr. Eavesdrop, with a printed sketch of
the Reverend Doctor F., presented itself before him, and he began
mechanically to flourish his bamboo.&nbsp; The movement was
prompted by his good genius, for the uplifted bamboo received the
blow of a ponderous cudgel, which was intended for his
head.&nbsp; The reverend gentleman recoiled two or three paces,
and saw before him a couple of ruffians, who were preparing to
renew the attack, but whom, with two swings of his bamboo, he
laid with cracked sconces on the earth, where he proceeded to
deal with them like corn beneath the flail of the thresher.&nbsp;
One of them drew a pistol, which went off in the very act of
being struck aside by the bamboo, and lodged a bullet in the
brain of the other.&nbsp; There was then only one enemy, who
vainly struggled to rise, every effort being attended with a new
and more signal prostration.&nbsp; The fellow roared for
mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mercy, rascal!&rdquo; cried the divine;
&ldquo;what mercy were you going to show me, villain?&nbsp;
What!&nbsp; I warrant me, you thought it would be an easy matter,
and no sin, to rob and murder a parson on his way home from
dinner.&nbsp; You said to yourself, doubtless, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
waylay the fat parson (you irreverent knave), as he waddles home
(you disparaging ruffian), half-seas-over, (you calumnious
vagabond).&rdquo;&nbsp; And with every dyslogistic term, which he
supposed had been applied to himself, he inflicted a new bruise
on his rolling and roaring antagonist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,
rogue!&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;you can roar now, marauder;
you were silent enough when you devoted my brains to dispersion
under your cudgel.&nbsp; But seeing that I cannot bind you, and
that I intend you not to escape, and that it would be dangerous
to let you rise, I will disable you in all your members.&nbsp; I
will contund you as Thestylis did strong smelling herbs, in the
quality whereof you do most gravely partake, as my nose beareth
testimony, ill weed that you are.&nbsp; I will beat you to a
jelly, and I will then roll you into the ditch, to lie till the
constable comes for you, thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold! hold! reverend sir,&rdquo; exclaimed the penitent
culprit, &ldquo;I am disabled already in every finger, and in
every joint.&nbsp; I will roll myself into the ditch, reverend
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stir not, rascal,&rdquo; returned the divine,
&ldquo;stir not so much as the quietest leaf above you, or my
bamboo rebounds on your body, like hail in a thunder-storm.&nbsp;
Confess, speedily, villain; are you a simple thief, or would you
have manufactured me into a subject for the benefit of
science?&nbsp; Ay, miscreant caitiff, you would have made me a
subject for science, would you?&nbsp; You are a school-master
abroad, are you?&nbsp; You are marching with a detachment of the
march of mind, are you?&nbsp; You are a member of the Steam
Intellect Society, are you?&nbsp; You swear by the learned
friend, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! reverend sir,&rdquo; answered the criminal,
&ldquo;I am innocent of all these offences, whatever they are,
reverend sir.&nbsp; The only friend I had in the world is lying
dead beside me, reverend sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reverend gentleman paused a moment, and leaned on his
bamboo.&nbsp; The culprit, bruised as he was, sprang on his legs,
and went off in double quick time.&nbsp; The Doctor gave him
chase, and had nearly brought him within arm&rsquo;s length, when
the fellow turned at right angles, and sprang clean over a deep
dry ditch.&nbsp; The divine, following with equal ardour, and
less dexterity, went down over head and ears into a thicket of
nettles.&nbsp; Emerging with much discomposure, he proceeded to
the village, and roused the constable; but the constable found,
on reaching the scene of action, that the dead man was gone, as
well as his living accomplice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the monster!&rdquo; exclaimed the Reverend Doctor
Folliott, &ldquo;he has made a subject for science of the only
friend he had in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, my
dear,&rdquo; he resumed, the next morning at breakfast, &ldquo;if
my old reading, and my early gymnastics (for, as the great
Hermann says, before I was demulced by the Muses, I was
<i>ferocis ingenii puer</i>, <i>et ad arma quam ad literas
paratior</i>), had not imbued me indelibly with some of the holy
rage of <i>Fr&egrave;re Jean des Entommeures</i>, I should be, at
this moment, lying on the table of some flinty-hearted anatomist,
who would have sliced and disjointed me as unscrupulously as I do
these remnants of the capon and chine, wherewith you consoled
yourself yesterday for my absence at dinner.&nbsp; Phew! I have a
noble thirst upon me, which I will quench with floods of
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reverend gentleman was interrupted by a messenger, who
informed him that the Charity Commissioners requested his
presence at the inn, where they were holding a sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Charity Commissioners!&rdquo; exclaimed the
reverend gentleman, &ldquo;who on earth are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messenger could not inform him, and the reverend gentleman
took his hat and stick, and proceeded to the inn.</p>
<p>On entering the best parlour, he saw three well-dressed and
bulky gentlemen sitting at a table, and a fourth officiating as
clerk, with an open book before him, and a pen in his hand.&nbsp;
The church-wardens, who had been also summoned, were already in
attendance.</p>
<p>The chief commissioner politely requested the Reverend Doctor
Folliott to be seated, and after the usual meteorological
preliminaries had been settled by a resolution, <i>nem. con.</i>,
that it was a fine day but very hot, the chief commissioner
stated, that in virtue of the commission of Parliament, which
they had the honour to hold, they were now to inquire into the
state of the public charities of this village.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;The state of the public
charities, sir, is exceedingly simple.&nbsp; There are
none.&nbsp; The charities here are all private, and so private,
that I for one know nothing of them.</p>
<p><i>First Commissioner</i>.&mdash;We have been informed, sir,
that there is an annual rent charged on the land of Hautbois, for
the endowment and repair of an almshouse.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Hautbois! Hautbois!</p>
<p><i>First Commissioner</i>.&mdash;The manorial farm of
Hautbois, now occupied by Farmer Seedling, is charged with the
endowment and maintenance of an almshouse.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i> (<i>to the
Churchwarden</i>).&nbsp; How is this, Mr. Bluenose?</p>
<p><i>First Churchwarden</i>.&mdash;I really do not know,
sir.&nbsp; What say you, Mr. Appletwig?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Appletwig</i> (<i>parish clerk and schoolmaster</i>;
<i>an old man</i>).&nbsp; I do remember, gentlemen, to have been
informed, that there did stand, at the end of the village, a
ruined cottage, which had once been an almshouse, which was
endowed and maintained, by an annual revenue of a mark and a
half, or one pound sterling, charged some centuries ago on the
farm of Hautbois; but the means, by the progress of time, having
become inadequate to the end, the almshouse tumbled to
pieces.</p>
<p><i>First Commissioner</i>.&mdash;But this is a right which
cannot be abrogated by desuetude, and the sum of one pound per
annum is still chargeable for charitable purposes on the manorial
farm of Hautbois.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Very well, sir.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Appletwig</i>.&mdash;But, sir, the one pound per annum
is still received by the parish, but was long ago, by an
unanimous vote in open vestry, given to the minister.</p>
<p><i>The Three Commissioners</i> (<i>un&acirc; voce</i>).&nbsp;
The minister!</p>
<p><i>First Commissioner</i>.&mdash;This is an unjustifiable
proceeding.</p>
<p><i>Second Commissioner</i>.&mdash;A misappropriation of a
public fund.</p>
<p><i>Third Commissioner</i>.&mdash;A flagrant perversion of a
charitable donation.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;God bless my soul,
gentlemen!&nbsp; I know nothing of this matter.&nbsp; How is
this, Mr. Bluenose?&nbsp; Do I receive this one pound per
annum?</p>
<p><i>First Churchwarden</i>.&mdash;Really, sir, I know no more
about it than you do.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Appletwig</i>.&mdash;You certainly receive it,
sir.&nbsp; It was voted to one of your predecessors.&nbsp; Farmer
Seedling lumps it in with his tithes.</p>
<p><i>First Commissioner</i>.&mdash;Lumps it in, sir!&nbsp; Lump
in a charitable donation!</p>
<p><i>Second and Third Commissioner</i>.&mdash;Oh-oh-oh-h-h!</p>
<p><i>First Commissioner</i>.&mdash;Reverend sir, and gentlemen,
officers of this parish, we are under the necessity of
admonishing you that this is a most improper proceeding: and you
are hereby duly admonished accordingly.&nbsp; Make a record, Mr.
Milky.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Milky</i> (<i>writing</i>).&nbsp; The clergyman and
church-wardens of the village of Hm-ra-m-m- gravely
admonished.&nbsp; Hm-m-m-m.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Is that all,
gentlemen?</p>
<p><i>The Commissioners</i>.&mdash;That is all, sir; and we wish
you a good morning.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;A very good morning to
you, gentlemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of all that is wonderful, Mr.
Bluenose,&rdquo; said the Reverend Doctor Folliott, as he walked
out of the inn, &ldquo;what in the name of all that is wonderful,
can those fellows mean?&nbsp; They have come here in a chaise and
four, to make a fuss about a pound per annum, which, after all,
they leave as it was: I wonder who pays them for their trouble,
and how much.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Appletwig</i>.&mdash;The public pay for it, sir.&nbsp;
It is a job of the learned friend whom you admire so much.&nbsp;
It makes away with public money in salaries, and private money in
lawsuits, and does no particle of good to any living soul.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Ay, ay, Mr. Appletwig;
that is just the sort of public service to be looked for from the
learned friend.&nbsp; Oh, the learned friend! the learned
friend!&nbsp; He is the evil genius of everything that falls in
his way.</p>
<p>The Reverend Doctor walked off to Crotchet Castle, to narrate
his misadventures, and exhale his budget of grievances on Mr. Mac
Quedy, whom he considered a ringleader of the march of mind.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Four</span> beautiful cabined pinnaces,
one for the ladies, one for the gentlemen, one for kitchen and
servants, one for a dining-room and band of music, weighed
anchor, on a fine July morning, from below Crotchet Castle, and
were towed merrily, by strong trotting horses, against the stream
of the Thames.&nbsp; They passed from the district of chalk,
successively into the districts of clay, of sand-rock, of oolite,
and so forth.&nbsp; Sometimes they dined in their floating
dining-room, sometimes in tents, which they pitched on the dry,
smooth-shaven green of a newly-mown meadow: sometimes they left
their vessels to see sights in the vicinity; sometimes they
passed a day or two in a comfortable inn.</p>
<p>At Oxford, they walked about to see the curiosities of
architecture, painted windows, and undisturbed libraries.&nbsp;
The Reverend Doctor Folliott laid a wager with Mr. Crotchet
&ldquo;that in all their perlustrations they would not find a man
reading,&rdquo; and won it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the
reverend gentleman, &ldquo;this is still a seat of learning, on
the principle of&mdash;once a captain, always a captain.&nbsp; We
may well ask, in these great reservoirs of books whereof no man
ever draws a sluice, <i>Quorsum pertinuit stipere Platona
Menandro</i>?&nbsp; What is done here for the classics?&nbsp;
Reprinting German editions on better paper.&nbsp; A great boast,
verily!&nbsp; What for mathematics?&nbsp; What for
metaphysics?&nbsp; What for history?&nbsp; What for anything
worth knowing?&nbsp; This was a seat of learning in the days of
Friar Bacon.&nbsp; But the Friar is gone, and his learning with
him.&nbsp; Nothing of him is left but the immortal nose, which,
when his brazen head had tumbled to pieces, crying
&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s Past,&rdquo; was the only palpable fragment
among its minutely pulverised atoms, and which is still
resplendent over the portals of its cognominal college.&nbsp;
That nose, sir, is the only thing to which I shall take off my
hat, in all this Babylon of buried literature.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;But, doctor, it is something to
have a great reservoir of learning, at which some may draw if
they please.</p>

carried off by any one, it would be evidence of something to hope
for.&nbsp; But the system of dissuasion from all good learning is
brought here to a pitch of perfection that baffles the keenest
aspirant.&nbsp; I run over to myself the names of the scholars of
Germany, a glorious catalogue: but ask for those of
Oxford,&mdash;Where are they?&nbsp; The echoes of their courts,
as vacant as their heads, will answer, Where are they?&nbsp; The
tree shall be known by its fruit: and seeing that this great
tree, with all its specious seeming, brings forth no fruit, I do
denounce it as a barren fig.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;I shall set you right on this
point.&nbsp; We do nothing without motives.&nbsp; If learning get
nothing but honour, and very little of that; and if the good
things of this world, which ought to be the rewards of learning,
become the mere gifts of self-interested patronage; you must not
wonder if, in the finishing of education, the science which takes
precedence of all others, should be the science of currying
favour.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Very true, sir.&nbsp;
Education is well finished, for all worldly purposes, when the
head is brought into the state whereinto I am accustomed to bring
a marrow-bone, when it has been set before me on a toast, with a
white napkin wrapped round it.&nbsp; Nothing trundles along the
high road of preferment so trimly as a well-biassed sconce,
picked clean within and polished without; <i>totus teres atque
rotundus</i>.&nbsp; The perfection of the finishing lies in the
bias, which keeps it trundling in the given direction.&nbsp;
There is good and sufficient reason for the fig being barren, but
it is not therefore the less a barren fig.</p>
<p>At Godstow, they gathered hazel on the grave of Rosamond; and,
proceeding on their voyage, fell into a discussion on legendary
histories.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;History is but a tiresome thing in
itself: it becomes more agreeable the more romance is mixed up
with it.&nbsp; The great enchanter has made me learn many things
which I should never have dreamed of studying, if they had not
come to me in the form of amusement.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;What enchanter is
that?&nbsp; There are two enchanters: he of the north, and he of
the south.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;Rossini!</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Ay, there is another
enchanter.&nbsp; But I mean the great enchanter of Covent Garden:
he who, for more than a quarter of a century, has produced two
pantomimes a year, to the delight of children of all ages;
including myself at all ages.&nbsp; That is the enchanter for
me.&nbsp; I am for the pantomimes.&nbsp; All the northern
enchanter&rsquo;s romances put together would not furnish
materials for half the Southern enchanter&rsquo;s pantomimes.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Surely you do not class literature
with pantomime?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;In these cases, I
do.&nbsp; They are both one, with a slight difference.&nbsp; The
one is the literature of pantomime, the other is the pantomime of
literature.&nbsp; There is the same variety of character, the
same diversity of story, the same copiousness of incident, the
same research into costume, the same display of heraldry,
falconry, minstrelsy, scenery, monkery, witchery, devilry,
robbery, poachery, piracy, fishery, gipsy-astrology, demonology,
architecture, fortification, castrametation, navigation; the same
running base of love and battle.&nbsp; The main difference is,
that the one set of amusing fictions is told in music and action;
the other in all the worst dialects of the English
language.&nbsp; As to any sentence worth remembering, any moral
or political truth, anything having a tendency, however remote,
to make men wiser or better, to make them think, to make them
ever think of thinking; they are both precisely alike
<i>nuspiam</i>, <i>nequaquam</i>, <i>nullibi</i>,
<i>nullimodis</i>.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Very amusing, however.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Very amusing, very
amusing.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;My quarrel with the northern
enchanter is, that he has grossly misrepresented the twelfth
century.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;He has misrepresented
everything, or he would not have been very amusing.&nbsp; Sober
truth is but dull matter to the reading rabble.&nbsp; The angler,
who puts not on his hook the bait that best pleases the fish, may
sit all day on the bank without catching a gudgeon.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;But how do you mean that he has
misrepresented the twelfth century?&nbsp; By exhibiting some of
its knights and ladies in the colours of refinement and virtue,
seeing that they were all no better than ruffians, and something
else that shall be nameless?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;By no means.&nbsp; By depicting
them as much worse than they were, not, as you suppose, much
better.&nbsp; No one would infer from his pictures that theirs
was a much better state of society than this which we live
in.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;No, nor was it.&nbsp; It was a
period of brutality, ignorance, fanaticism, and tyranny; when the
land was covered with castles, and every castle contained a gang
of banditti, headed by a titled robber, who levied contributions
with fire and sword; plundering, torturing, ravishing, burying
his captives in loathsome dungeons, and broiling them on
gridirons, to force from them the surrender of every particle of
treasure which he suspected them of possessing; and fighting
every now and then with the neighbouring lords, his conterminal
bandits, for the right of marauding on the boundaries.&nbsp; This
was the twelfth century, as depicted by all contemporary
historians and poets.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;No, sir.&nbsp; Weigh the evidence
of specific facts; you will find more good than evil.&nbsp; Who
was England&rsquo;s greatest hero&mdash;the mirror of chivalry,
the pattern of honour, the fountain of generosity, the model to
all succeeding ages of military glory?&nbsp; Richard the
First.&nbsp; There is a king of the twelfth century.&nbsp; What
was the first step of liberty?&nbsp; Magna Charta.&nbsp; That was
the best thing ever done by lords.&nbsp; There are lords of the
twelfth century.&nbsp; You must remember, too, that these lords
were petty princes, and made war on each other as legitimately as
the heads of larger communities did or do.&nbsp; For their system
of revenue, it was, to be sure, more rough and summary than that
which has succeeded it, but it was certainly less searching and
less productive.&nbsp; And as to the people, I content myself
with these great points: that every man was armed, every man was
a good archer, every man could and would fight effectively, with
sword or pike, or even with oaken cudgel; no man would live
quietly without beef and ale if he had them not; he fought till
he either got them, or was put out of condition to want
them.&nbsp; They were not, and could not be, subjected to that
powerful pressure of all the other classes of society, combined
by gunpowder, steam, and <i>fiscality</i>, which has brought them
to that dismal degradation in which we see them now.&nbsp; And
there are the people of the twelfth century.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;As to your king, the enchanter has
done him ample justice, even in your own view.&nbsp; As to your
lords and their ladies, he has drawn them too favourably, given
them too many of the false colours of chivalry, thrown too
attractive a light on their abominable doings.&nbsp; As to the
people, he keeps them so much in the background, that he can
hardly be said to have represented them at all, much less
misrepresented them, which indeed he could scarcely do, seeing
that, by your own showing, they were all thieves, ready to knock
down any man for what they could not come by honestly.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;No, sir.&nbsp; They could come
honestly by beef and ale, while they were left to their simple
industry.&nbsp; When oppression interfered with them in that,
then they stood on the defensive, and fought for what they were
not permitted to come by quietly.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;If A., being aggrieved by B.,
knocks down C., do you call that standing on the defensive?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;That depends on who or what C.
is.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Gentlemen, you will never
settle this controversy till you have first settled what is good
for man in this world; the great question, <i>de finibus</i>,
which has puzzled all philosophers.&nbsp; If the enchanter has
represented the twelfth century too brightly for one, and too
darkly for the other of you, I should say, as an impartial man,
he has represented it fairly.&nbsp; My quarrel with him is, that
his works contain nothing worth quoting; and a book that
furnishes no quotations, is <i>me judice</i>, no book&mdash;it is
a plaything.&nbsp; There is no question about the
amusement,&mdash;amusement of multitudes; but if he who amuses us
most is to be our enchanter &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&rsquo;
&#7952;&xi;&omicron;&chi;&#8052;&nu;, then my enchanter is the
enchanter of Covent Garden.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE VOYAGE, CONTINUED.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>Continuant nostre routte, navigasmes par trois
jours <i>sans rien descouvrir</i>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rabelais</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">There</span> is a beautiful
structure,&rdquo; said Mr. Chainmail, as they glided by Lechlade
church; &ldquo;a subject for the pencil, Captain.&nbsp; It is a
question worth asking, Mr. Mac Quedy, whether the religious
spirit which reared these edifices, and connected with them
everywhere an asylum for misfortune, and a provision for poverty,
was not better than the commercial spirit, which has turned all
the business of modern life into schemes of profit and processes
of fraud and extortion.&nbsp; I do not see, in all your boasted
improvements, any compensation for the religious charity of the
twelfth century.&nbsp; I do not see any compensation for that
kindly feeling which, within their own little communities, bound
the several classes of society together, while full scope was
left for the development of natural character, wherein
individuals differed as conspicuously as in costume.&nbsp; Now,
we all wear one conventional dress, one conventional face; we
have no bond of union but pecuniary interest; we talk anything
that comes uppermost for talking&rsquo;s sake, and without
expecting to be believed; we have no nature, no simplicity, no
picturesqueness: everything about us is as artificial and as
complicated as our steam-machinery: our poetry is a kaleidoscope
of false imagery, expressing no real feeling, portraying no real
existence.&nbsp; I do not see any compensation for the poetry of
the twelfth century.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;I wonder to hear you, Mr.
Chainmail, talking of the religious charity of a set of lazy
monks and beggarly friars, who were much more occupied with
taking than giving; of whom those who were in earnest did nothing
but make themselves and everybody about them miserable with
fastings and penances, and other such trash; and those who were
not, did nothing but guzzle and royster, and, having no wives of
their own, took very unbecoming liberties with those of honester
men.&nbsp; And as to your poetry of the twelfth century, it is
not good for much.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;It has, at any rate, what ours
wants, truth to nature and simplicity of diction.</p>
<p>The poetry, which was addressed to the people of the dark
ages, pleased in proportion to the truth with which it depicted
familiar images, and to their natural connection with the time
and place to which they were assigned.&nbsp; In the poetry of our
enlightened times, the characteristics of all seasons, soils, and
climates may be blended together with much benefit to the
author&rsquo;s fame as an original genius.&nbsp; The cowslip of a
civic poet is always in blossom, his fern is always in full
feather; he gathers the celandine, the primrose, the
heath-flower, the jasmine, and the chrysanthemum all on the same
day and from the same spot; his nightingale sings all the year
round, his moon is always full, his cygnet is as white as his
swan, his cedar is as tremulous as his aspen, and his poplar as
embowering as his beech.&nbsp; Thus all nature marches with the
march of mind; but among barbarians, instead of mead and wine,
and the best seat by the fire, the reward of such a genius would
have been to be summarily turned out of doors in the snow, to
meditate on the difference between day and night and between
December and July.&nbsp; It is an age of liberality, indeed, when
not to know an oak from a burdock is no disqualification for
sylvan minstrelsy.&nbsp; I am for truth and simplicity.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Let him who loves them
read Greek: Greek, Greek, Greek.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;If he can, sir.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Very true, sir; if he
can.&nbsp; Here is the Captain who can.&nbsp; But I think he must
have finished his education at some very rigid college, where a
quotation or any other overt act showing acquaintance with
classical literature was visited with a severe penalty.&nbsp; For
my part, I make it my boast that I was not to be so
subdued.&nbsp; I could not be abated of a single quotation by all
the bumpers in which I was fined.</p>
<p>In this manner they glided over the face of the waters,
discussing everything and settling nothing.&nbsp; Mr. Mac Quedy
and the Reverend Doctor Folliott had many digladiations on
political economy: wherein, each in his own view, Doctor Folliott
demolished Mr. Mac Quedy&rsquo;s science, and Mr. Mac Quedy
demolished Dr. Folliott&rsquo;s objections.</p>
<p>We would print these dialogues if we thought anyone would read
them; but the world is not yet ripe for this <i>haute sagesse
Pantagrueline</i>.&nbsp; We must therefore content ourselves with
an <i>&eacute;chantillon</i> of one of the Reverend
Doctor&rsquo;s perorations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have given the name of a science to what is yet an
imperfect inquiry, and the upshot of your so-called science is
this: that you increase the wealth of a nation by increasing in
it the quantity of things which are produced by labour: no matter
what they are, no matter how produced, no matter how
distributed.&nbsp; The greater the quantity of labour that has
gone to the production of the quantity of things in a community,
the richer is the community.&nbsp; That is your doctrine.&nbsp;
Now, I say, if this be so, riches are not the object for a
community to aim at.&nbsp; I say the nation is best off, in
relation to other nations, which has the greatest quantity of the
common necessaries of life distributed among the greatest number
of persons; which has the greatest number of honest hearts and
stout arms united in a common interest, willing to offend no one,
but ready to fight in defence of their own community against all
the rest of the world, because they have something in it worth
fighting for.&nbsp; The moment you admit that one class of
things, without any reference to what they respectively cost, is
better worth having than another; that a smaller commercial
value, with one mode of distribution, is better than a greater
commercial value, with another mode of distribution; the whole of
that curious fabric of postulates and dogmas, which you call the
science of political economy, and which I call <i>politic&aelig;
&aelig;conomi&aelig; inscientia</i>, tumbles to
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Toogood agreed with Mr. Chainmail against Mr. Mac Quedy,
that the existing state of society was worse than that of the
twelfth century; but he agreed with Mr. Mac Quedy against Mr.
Chainmail, that it was in progress to something much better than
either&mdash;to which &ldquo;something much better&rdquo; Mr.
Toogood and Mr. Mac Quedy attached two very different
meanings.</p>
<p>Mr. Chainmail fought with Doctor Folliott, the battle of the
romantic against the classical in poetry; and Mr. Skionar
contended with Mr. Mac Quedy for intuition and synthesis, against
analysis and induction in philosophy.</p>
<p>Mr. Philpot would lie along for hours, listening to the
gurgling of the water round the prow, and would occasionally
edify the company with speculations on the great changes that
would be effected in the world by the steam-navigation of rivers:
sketching the course of a steamboat up and down some mighty
stream which civilisation had either never visited, or long since
deserted; the Missouri and the Columbia, the Oroonoko and the
Amazon, the Nile and the Niger, the Euphrates and the Tigris, the
Oxus and the Indus, the Ganges and the Hoangho; under the over
canopying forests of the new, or by the long-silent ruins of the
ancient, world; through the shapeless mounds of Babylon, or the
gigantic temples of Thebes.</p>
<p>Mr. Trillo went on with the composition of his opera, and took
the opinions of the young ladies on every step in its progress;
occasionally regaling the company with specimens; and wondering
at the blindness of Mr. Mac Quedy, who could not, or would not,
see that an opera in perfection, being the union of all the
beautiful arts&mdash;music, painting, dancing,
poetry&mdash;exhibiting female beauty in its most attractive
aspects, and in its most becoming costume&mdash;was, according to
the well-known precept, <i>Ingenuas didicisse</i>, etc., the most
efficient instrument of civilisation, and ought to take
precedence of all other pursuits in the minds of true
philanthropists.&nbsp; The Reverend Doctor Folliott, on these
occasions, never failed to say a word or two on Mr.
Trillo&rsquo;s side, derived from the practice of the Athenians,
and from the combination, in their theatre, of all the beautiful
arts, in a degree of perfection unknown to the modern world.</p>
<p>Leaving Lechlade, they entered the canal that connects the
Thames with the Severn; ascended by many locks; passed by a
tunnel, three miles long, through the bowels of Sapperton Hill;
agreed unanimously that the greatest pleasure derivable from
visiting a cavern of any sort was that of getting out of it;
descended by many locks again through the valley of Stroud into
the Severn; continued their navigation into the Ellesmere canal;
moored their pinnaces in the Vale of Llangollen by the aqueduct
of Pontycysyllty; and determined to pass some days in inspecting
the scenery, before commencing their homeward voyage.</p>
<p>The Captain omitted no opportunity of pressing his suit on
Lady Clarinda, but could never draw from her any reply but the
same doctrines of worldly wisdom, delivered in a tone of
<i>badinage</i>, mixed with a certain kindness of manner that
induced him to hope she was not in earnest.</p>
<p>But the morning after they had anchored under the hills of the
Dee&mdash;whether the lady had reflected more seriously than
usual, or was somewhat less in good humour than usual, or the
Captain was more pressing than usual&mdash;she said to him:
&ldquo;It must not be, Captain Fitzchrome; &lsquo;the course of
true love never did run smooth:&rsquo; my father must keep his
borough, and I must have a town house and a country house, and an
opera box, and a carriage.&nbsp; It is not well for either of us
that we should flirt any longer: &lsquo;I must be cruel only to
be kind.&rsquo;&nbsp; Be satisfied with the assurance that you
alone, of all men, have ever broken my rest.&nbsp; To be sure, it
was only for about three nights in all; but that is too
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain had <i>le c&oelig;ur navr&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; He
took his portfolio under his arm, made up the little
<i>valise</i> of a pedestrian, and, without saying a word to
anyone, wandered off at random among the mountains.</p>
<p>After the lapse of a day or two, the Captain was missed, and
everyone marvelled what was become of him.&nbsp; Mr. Philpot
thought he must have been exploring a river, and fallen in and
got drowned in the process.&nbsp; Mr. Firedamp had no doubt he
had been crossing a mountain bog, and had been suddenly deprived
of life by the exhalations of marsh miasmata.&nbsp; Mr. Henbane
deemed it probable that he had been tempted in some wood by the
large black brilliant berries of the <i>Atropa Belladonna</i>, or
Deadly Nightshade; and lamented that he had not been by, to
administer an infallible antidote.&nbsp; Mr. Eavesdrop hoped the
particulars of his fate would be ascertained; and asked if anyone
present could help him to any authentic anecdotes of their
departed friend.&nbsp; The Reverend Doctor Folliott proposed that
an inquiry should be instituted as to whether the march of
intellect had reached that neighbourhood, as, if so, the Captain
had probably been made a subject for science.&nbsp; Mr. Mac Quedy
said it was no such great matter to ascertain the precise mode in
which the surplus population was diminished by one.&nbsp; Mr.
Toogood asseverated that there was no such thing as surplus
population, and that the land, properly managed, would maintain
twenty times its present inhabitants; and hereupon they fell into
a disputation.</p>
<p>Lady Clarinda did not doubt that the Captain had gone away
designedly; she missed him more than she could have anticipated,
and wished she had at least postponed her last piece of cruelty
till the completion of their homeward voyage.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CORRESPONDENCE.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Base is the slave that
pays.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ancient Pistol</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Captain was neither drowned nor
poisoned, neither miasmatised nor anatomised.&nbsp; But, before
we proceed to account for him, we must look back to a young lady,
of whom some little notice was taken in the first chapter; and
who, though she has since been out of sight, has never with us
been out of mind: Miss Susannah Touchandgo, the forsaken of the
junior Crotchet, whom we left an inmate of a solitary farm, in
one of the deep valleys under the cloud-capt summits of Meirion,
comforting her wounded spirit with air and exercise, rustic
cheer, music, painting, and poetry, and the prattle of the little
Ap Llymrys.</p>
<p>One evening, after an interval of anxious expectation, the
farmer, returning from market brought for her two letters, of
which the contents were these:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:
right">&ldquo;<i>Dotandcarryonetown</i>, <i>State of
Apodidraskiana</i>.<br />
&ldquo;<i>April</i> 1, 18..</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Child</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am anxious to learn what are your present position,
intention, and prospects.&nbsp; The fairies who dropped gold in
your shoe, on the morning when I ceased to be a respectable man
in London, will soon find a talismanic channel for transmitting
you a stocking full of dollars, which will fit the shoe as well
as the foot of Cinderella fitted her slipper.&nbsp; I am happy to
say I am again become a respectable man.&nbsp; It was always my
ambition to be a respectable man, and I am a very respectable man
here, in this new township of a new state, where I have purchased
five thousand acres of land, at two dollars an acre, hard cash,
and established a very flourishing bank.&nbsp; The notes of
Touchandgo and Company, soft cash, are now the exclusive currency
of all this vicinity.&nbsp; This is the land in which all men
flourish; but there are three classes of men who flourish
especially,&mdash;methodist preachers, slave-drivers, and
paper-money manufacturers; and as one of the latter, I have just
painted the word BANK on a fine slab of maple, which was green
and growing when I arrived, and have discounted for the settlers,
in my own currency, sundry bills, which are to be paid when the
proceeds of the crop they have just sown shall return from New
Orleans; so that my notes are the representatives of vegetation
that is to be, and I am accordingly a capitalist of the first
magnitude.&nbsp; The people here know very well that I ran away
from London; but the most of them have run away from some place
or other; and they have a great respect for me, because they
think I ran away with something worth taking, which few of them
had the luck or the wit to do.&nbsp; This gives them confidence
in my resources, at the same time that, as there is nothing
portable in the settlement except my own notes, they have no fear
that I shall run away with them.&nbsp; They know I am thoroughly
conversant with the principles of banking, and as they have
plenty of industry, no lack of sharpness, and abundance of land,
they wanted nothing but capital to organise a flourishing
settlement; and this capital I have manufactured to the extent
required, at the expense of a small importation of pens, ink, and
paper, and two or three inimitable copper plates.&nbsp; I have
abundance here of all good things, a good conscience included;
for I really cannot see that I have done any wrong.&nbsp; This
was my position: I owed half a million of money; and I had a
trifle in my pocket.&nbsp; It was clear that this trifle could
never find its way to the right owner.&nbsp; The question was,
whether I should keep it, and live like a gentleman; or hand it
over to lawyers and commissioners of bankruptcy, and die like a
dog on a dunghill.&nbsp; If I could have thought that the said
lawyers, etc., had a better title to it than myself, I might have
hesitated; but, as such title was not apparent to my
satisfaction, I decided the question in my own favour, the right
owners, as I have already said, being out of the question
altogether.&nbsp; I have always taken scientific views of morals
and politics, a habit from which I derive much comfort under
existing circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you adhere to your music, though I cannot hope
again to accompany your harp with my flute.&nbsp; My last
<i>andante</i> movement was too <i>forte</i> for those whom it
took by surprise.&nbsp; Let not your <i>allegro vivace</i> be
damped by young Crotchet&rsquo;s desertion, which, though I have
not heard it, I take for granted.&nbsp; He is, like myself, a
scientific politician, and has an eye as keen as a needle to his
own interest.&nbsp; He has had good luck so far, and is gorgeous
in the spoils of many gulls; but I think the Polar Basin and
Walrus Company will be too much for him yet.&nbsp; There has been
a splendid outlay on credit, and he is the only man, of the
original parties concerned, of whom his Majesty&rsquo;s sheriffs
could give any account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not ask you to come here.&nbsp; There is no
husband for you.&nbsp; The men smoke, drink, and fight, and break
more of their own heads than of girls&rsquo; hearts.&nbsp; Those
among them who are musical, sing nothing but psalms.&nbsp; They
are excellent fellows in their way, but you would not like
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Au reste</i>, here are no rents, no taxes, no
poor-rates, no tithes, no church establishment, no routs, no
clubs, no rotten boroughs, no operas, no concerts, no theatres,
no beggars, no thieves, no king, no lords, no ladies, and only
one gentleman, videlicet, your loving father,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Timothy
Touchandgo</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I send you one of my notes; I can afford to
part with it.&nbsp; If you are accused of receiving money from
me, you may pay it over to my assignees.&nbsp; Robthetill
continues to be my factotum; I say no more of him in this place:
he will give you an account of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Dotandcarryonetown</i>,
<i>etc.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Touchandgo will have told you of our arrival here,
of our setting up a bank, and so forth.&nbsp; We came here in a
tilted waggon, which served us for parlour, kitchen, and
all.&nbsp; We soon got up a log-house; and, unluckily, we as soon
got it down again, for the first fire we made in it burned down
house and all.&nbsp; However, our second experiment was more
fortunate; and we are pretty well lodged in a house of three
rooms on a floor; I should say the floor, for there is but
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This new state is free to hold slaves; all the new
states have not this privilege: Mr. Touchandgo has bought some,
and they are building him a villa.&nbsp; Mr. Touchandgo is in a
thriving way, but he is not happy here: he longs for parties and
concerts, and a seat in Congress.&nbsp; He thinks it very hard
that he cannot buy one with his own coinage, as he used to do in
England.&nbsp; Besides, he is afraid of the Regulators, who, if
they do not like a man&rsquo;s character, wait upon him and flog
him, doubling the dose at stated intervals, till he takes himself
off.&nbsp; He does not like this system of administering justice:
though I think he has nothing to fear from it.&nbsp; He has the
character of having money, which is the best of all characters
here, as at home.&nbsp; He lets his old English prejudices
influence his opinions of his new neighbours; but, I assure you,
they have many virtues.&nbsp; Though they do keep slaves, they
are all ready to fight for their own liberty; and I should not
like to be an enemy within reach of one of their rifles.&nbsp;
When I say enemy, I include bailiff in the term.&nbsp; One was
shot not long ago.&nbsp; There was a trial; the jury gave two
dollars damages; the judge said they must find guilty or not
guilty; but the counsel for the defendant (they would not call
him prisoner) offered to fight the judge upon the point: and as
this was said literally, not metaphorically, and the counsel was
a stout fellow, the judge gave in. The two dollars damages were
not paid after all; for the defendant challenged the foreman to
box for double or quits, and the foreman was beaten.&nbsp; The
folks in New York made a great outcry about it, but here it was
considered all as it should be.&nbsp; So you see, Miss, justice,
liberty, and everything else of that kind, are different in
different places, just as suits the convenience of those who have
the sword in their own hands.&nbsp; Hoping to hear of your health
and happiness, I remain,</p>

<p>Miss Touchandgo replied as follows to the first of these
letters:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear
Father</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you have the best of hearts, and I have no
doubt you have acted with the best intentions.&nbsp; My lover,
or, I should rather say, my fortune&rsquo;s lover, has indeed
forsaken me.&nbsp; I cannot say I did not feel it; indeed, I
cried very much; and the altered looks of people who used to be
so delighted to see me, really annoyed me so, that I determined
to change the scene altogether.&nbsp; I have come into Wales, and
am boarding with a farmer and his wife.&nbsp; Their stock of
English is very small; but I managed to agree with them, and they
have four of the sweetest children I ever saw, to whom I teach
all I know, and I manage to pick up some Welsh.&nbsp; I have
puzzled out a little song, which I think very pretty; I have
translated it into English, and I send it you, with the original
air.&nbsp; You shall play it on your flute at eight o&rsquo;clock
every Saturday evening, and I will play and sing it at the same
time, and I will fancy that I hear my dear papa accompanying
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people in London said very unkind things of you:
they hurt me very much at the time; but now I am out of their
way, I do not seem to think their opinion of much
consequence.&nbsp; I am sure, when I recollect, at leisure,
everything I have seen and heard among them, I cannot make out
what they do that is so virtuous, as to set them up for judges of
morals.&nbsp; And I am sure they never speak the truth about
anything, and there is no sincerity in either their love or their
friendship.&nbsp; An old Welsh bard here, who wears a waistcoat
embroidered with leeks, and is called the Green Bard of Cadeir
Idris, says the Scotch would be the best people in the world, if
there was nobody but themselves to give them a character: and so
I think would the Londoners.&nbsp; I hate the very thought of
them, for I do believe they would have broken my heart, if I had
not got out of their way.&nbsp; Now I shall write you another
letter very soon, and describe to you the country, and the
people, and the children, and how I amuse myself, and everything
that I think you will like to hear about: and when I seal this
letter, I shall drop a kiss on the cover.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Your loving daughter,</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Tell Mr. Robthetill I will write to him in a
day or two.&nbsp; This is the little song I spoke of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond the sea, beyond the sea,<br />
My heart is gone, far, far from me;<br />
And ever on its track will flee<br />
My thoughts, my dreams, beyond the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond the sea, beyond the sea,<br />
The swallow wanders fast and free;<br />
Oh, happy bird! were I like thee,<br />
I, too, would fly beyond the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond the sea, beyond the sea,<br />
Are kindly hearts and social glee:<br />
But here for me they may not be;<br />
My heart is gone beyond the sea.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Captain wandered despondingly
up and down hill for several days, passing many hours of each in
sitting on rocks; making, almost mechanically, sketches of
waterfalls, and mountain pools; taking care, nevertheless, to be
always before nightfall in a comfortable inn, where, being a
temperate man, he whiled away the evening with making a bottle of
sherry into negus.&nbsp; His rambles brought him at length into
the interior of Merionethshire, the land of all that is beautiful
in nature, and all that is lovely in woman.</p>
<p>Here, in a secluded village, he found a little inn, of small
pretension and much comfort.&nbsp; He felt so satisfied with his
quarters, and discovered every day so much variety in the scenes
of the surrounding mountains, that his inclination to proceed
farther diminished progressively.</p>
<p>It is one thing to follow the high road through a country,
with every principally remarkable object carefully noted down in
a book, taking, as therein directed, a guide, at particular
points, to the more recondite sights: it is another to sit down
on one chosen spot, especially when the choice is unpremeditated,
and from thence, by a series of explorations, to come day by day
on unanticipated scenes.&nbsp; The latter process has many
advantages over the former; it is free from the disappointment
which attends excited expectation, when imagination has
outstripped reality, and from the accidents that mar the scheme
of the tourist&rsquo;s single day, when the valleys may be
drenched with rain, or the mountains shrouded with mist.</p>
<p>The Captain was one morning preparing to sally forth on his
usual exploration, when he heard a voice without, inquiring for a
guide to the ruined castle.&nbsp; The voice seemed familiar to
him, and going forth into the gateway, he recognised Mr.
Chainmail.&nbsp; After greetings and inquiries for the absent:
&ldquo;You vanished very abruptly, Captain,&rdquo; said Mr.
Chainmail, &ldquo;from our party on the canal.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;To tell you the truth, I had
a particular reason for trying the effect of absence from a part
of that party.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;I surmised as much: at the same
time, the unusual melancholy of an in general most vivacious
young lady made me wonder at your having acted so
precipitately.&nbsp; The lady&rsquo;s heart is yours, if there be
truth in signs.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Hearts are not now what they
were in the days of the old song: &ldquo;Will love be controlled
by advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Very true; hearts, heads, and arms
have all degenerated, most sadly.&nbsp; We can no more feel the
high impassioned love of the ages, which some people have the
impudence to call dark, than we can wield King Richard&rsquo;s
battleaxe, bend Robin Hood&rsquo;s bow, or flourish the oaken
graft of the Pindar of Wakefield.&nbsp; Still we have our tastes
and feelings, though they deserve not the name of passions; and
some of us may pluck up spirit to try to carry a point, when we
reflect that we have to contend with men no better than
ourselves.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;We do not now break lances
for ladies.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;No; nor even bulrushes.&nbsp; We
jingle purses for them, flourish paper-money banners, and tilt
with scrolls of parchment.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;In which sort of tilting I
have been thrown from the saddle.&nbsp; I presume it was not love
that led you from the flotilla?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;By no means.&nbsp; I was tempted
by the sight of an old tower, not to leave this land of ruined
castles, without having collected a few hints for the adornment
of my baronial hall.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;I understand you live <i>en
famille</i> with your domestics.&nbsp; You will have more
difficulty in finding a lady who would adopt your fashion of
living, than one who would prefer you to a richer man.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Very true.&nbsp; I have tried the
experiment on several as guests; but once was enough for them:
so, I suppose, I shall die a bachelor.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;I see, like some others of my
friends, you will give up anything except your hobby.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;I will give up anything but my
baronial hall.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;You will never find a wife
for your purpose, unless in the daughter of some old-fashioned
farmer.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;No, I thank you.&nbsp; I must have
a lady of gentle blood; I shall not marry below my own condition:
I am too much of a herald; I have too much of the twelfth century
in me for that.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Why, then your chance is not
much better than mine.&nbsp; A well-born beauty would scarcely be
better pleased with your baronial hall than with my more humble
offer of love in a cottage.&nbsp; She must have a town-house, and
an opera-box, and roll about the streets in a carriage;
especially if her father has a rotten borough, for the sake of
which he sells his daughter, that he may continue to sell his
country.&nbsp; But you were inquiring for a guide to the ruined
castle in this vicinity; I know the way and will conduct you.</p>
<p>The proposal pleased Mr. Chainmail, and they set forth on
their expedition.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Would it not be a fine thing,
Captain, you being picturesque, and I poetical; you being for the
lights and shadows of the present, and I for those of the past;
if we were to go together over the ground which was travelled in
the twelfth century by Giraldus de Barri, when he accompanied
Archbishop Baldwin to preach the crusade?</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Nothing, in my present frame
of mind, could be more agreeable to me.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;We would provide ourselves with
his <i>Itinerarium</i>; compare what has been, with what is;
contemplate in their decay the castles and abbeys, which he saw
in their strength and splendour; and, while you were sketching
their remains, I would dispassionately inquire what has been
gained by the change.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Be it so.</p>
<p>But the scheme was no sooner arranged, than the Captain was
summoned to London by a letter on business, which he did not
expect to detain him long.&nbsp; Mr. Chainmail, who, like the
Captain, was fascinated with the inn and the scenery, determined
to await his companion&rsquo;s return; and, having furnished him
with a list of books, which he was to bring with him from London,
took leave of him, and began to pass his days like the heroes of
Ariosto, who</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;tutto il giorno, al bel oprar intenti,<br
/>
Saliron balze, e traversar torrenti.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day Mr. Chainmail traced upwards the course of a mountain
stream to a spot where a small waterfall threw itself over a slab
of perpendicular rock, which seemed to bar his farther
progress.&nbsp; On a nearer view, he discovered a flight of
steps, roughly hewn in the rock, on one side of the fall.&nbsp;
Ascending these steps, he entered a narrow winding pass, between
high and naked rocks, that afforded only space for a rough
footpath, carved on one side, at some height above the
torrent.</p>
<p>The pass opened on a lake, from which the stream issued, and
which lay like a dark mirror, set in a gigantic frame of mountain
precipices.&nbsp; Fragments of rock lay scattered on the edge of
the lake, some half-buried in the water: Mr. Chainmail scrambled
some way over these fragments, till the base of a rock sinking
abruptly in the water, effectually barred his progress.&nbsp; He
sat down on a large smooth stone; the faint murmur of the stream
he had quitted, the occasional flapping of the wings of the
heron, and at long intervals, the solitary springing of a trout,
were the only sounds that came to his ear.&nbsp; The sun shone
brightly half-way down the opposite rocks, presenting, on their
irregular faces, strong masses of light and shade.&nbsp; Suddenly
he heard the dash of a paddle, and, turning his eyes, saw a
solitary and beautiful girl gliding over the lake in a coracle:
she was proceeding from the vicinity of the point he had quitted,
towards the upper end of the lake.&nbsp; Her apparel was rustic,
but there was in its style something more
<i>recherch&eacute;e</i>, in its arrangement something more of
elegance and precision, than was common to the mountain peasant
girl.&nbsp; It had more of the <i>contadina</i> of the opera,
than of the genuine mountaineer; so at least thought Mr.
Chainmail; but she passed so rapidly, and took him so much by
surprise, that he had little opportunity for accurate
observation.&nbsp; He saw her land, at the farther extremity, and
disappear among the rocks: he rose from his seat, returned to the
mouth of the pass, stepped from stone to stone across the stream,
and attempted to pass round by the other side of the lake; but
there again the abruptly sinking precipice closed his way.</p>
<p>Day after day he haunted the spot, but never saw again either
the damsel or the coracle.&nbsp; At length, marvelling at himself
for being so solicitous about the apparition of a peasant girl in
a coracle, who could not, by any possibility, be anything to him,
he resumed his explorations in another direction.</p>
<p>One day he wandered to the ruined castle, on the sea-shore,
which was not very distant from his inn; and sitting on the rock,
near the base of the ruin, was calling up the forms of past ages
on the wall of an ivied tower, when on its summit appeared a
female figure, whom he recognised in an instant for his nymph of
the coracle.&nbsp; The folds of the blue gown pressed by the
sea-breeze against one of the most symmetrical of figures, the
black feather of the black hat, and the ringleted hair beneath it
fluttering in the wind; the apparent peril of her position, on
the edge of the mouldering wall, from whose immediate base the
rock went down perpendicularly to the sea, presented a singularly
interesting combination to the eye of the young antiquary.</p>
<p>Mr. Chainmail had to pass half round the castle, on the land
side, before he could reach the entrance: he coasted the dry and
bramble-grown moat, crossed the unguarded bridge, passed the
unportcullised arch of the gateway, entered the castle court,
ascertained the tower, ascended the broken stairs, and stood on
the ivied wall.&nbsp; But the nymph of the place was gone.&nbsp;
He searched the ruins within and without, but he found not what
he sought: he haunted the castle day after day, as he had done
the lake, but the damsel appeared no more.</p>

class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Susannah Touchandgo</span> had read
the four great poets of Italy, and many of the best writers of
France.&nbsp; About the time of her father&rsquo;s downfall,
accident threw into her way <i>Les R&eacute;veries du Promeneur
Solitaire</i>; and from the impression which these made on her,
she carried with her into retirement all the works of
Rousseau.&nbsp; In the midst of that startling light, which the
conduct of old friends on a sudden reverse of fortune throws on a
young and inexperienced mind, the doctrines of the philosopher of
Geneva struck with double force upon her sympathies: she imbibed
the sweet poison, as somebody calls it, of his writings, even to
a love of truth; which, every wise man knows, ought to be left to
those who can get anything by it.&nbsp; The society of children,
the beauties of nature, the solitude of the mountains, became her
consolation, and, by degrees, her delight.&nbsp; The gay society
from which she had been excluded, remained on her memory only as
a disagreeable dream.&nbsp; She imbibed her new monitor&rsquo;s
ideas of simplicity of dress, assimilating her own with that of
the peasant-girls in the neighbourhood: the black hat, the blue
gown, the black stockings, the shoes, tied on the instep.</p>
<p>Pride was, perhaps, at the bottom of the change: she was
willing to impose in some measure on herself, by marking a
contemptuous indifference to the characteristics of the class of
society from which she had fallen.</p>
<blockquote><p>And with the food of pride sustained her soul<br
/>
In solitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that she somewhat modified the forms of her rustic
dress: to the black hat she added a black feather, to the blue
gown she added a tippet, and a waistband fastened in front with a
silver buckle; she wore her black stockings very smooth and tight
on her ankles, and tied her shoes in tasteful bows, with the
nicest possible ribbon.&nbsp; In this apparel, to which, in
winter, she added a scarlet cloak, she made dreadful havoc among
the rustic mountaineers, many of whom proposed to &ldquo;keep
company&rdquo; with her in the Cambrian fashion, an honour which,
to their great surprise, she always declined.&nbsp; Among these,
Harry Ap-Heather, whose father rented an extensive sheepwalk, and
had a thousand she-lambs wandering in the mountains, was the most
strenuous in his suit, and the most pathetic in his lamentations
for her cruelty.</p>
<p>Miss Susannah often wandered among the mountains alone, even
to some distance from the farmhouse.&nbsp; Sometimes she
descended into the bottom of the dingles, to the black rocky beds
of the torrents, and dreamed away hours at the feet of the
cataracts.&nbsp; One spot in particular, from which she had at
first shrunk with terror, became by degrees her favourite
haunt.&nbsp; A path turning and returning at acute angles, led
down a steep wood-covered slope to the edge of a chasm, where a
pool, or resting-place of a torrent, lay far below.&nbsp; A
cataract fell in a single sheet into the pool; the pool boiled
and bubbled at the base of the fall, but through the greater part
of its extent, lay calm, deep, and black, as if the cataract had
plunged through it to an unimaginable depth, without disturbing
its eternal repose.&nbsp; At the opposite extremity of the pool,
the rocks almost met at their summits, the trees of the opposite
banks intermingled their leaves, and another cataract plunged
from the pool into a chasm, on which the sunbeams never
gleamed.&nbsp; High above, on both sides, the steep woody slopes
of the dingle soared into the sky; and from a fissure in the
rock, on which the little path terminated, a single gnarled and
twisted oak stretched itself over the pool, forming a fork with
its boughs at a short distance from the rock.&nbsp; Miss Susannah
often sat on the rock, with her feet resting on this tree; in
time, she made her seat on the tree itself, with her feet hanging
over the abyss; and at length, she accustomed herself to lie
along upon its trunk, with her side on the mossy bole of the
fork, and an arm round one of the branches.&nbsp; From this
position a portion of the sky and the woods was reflected in the
pool, which, from its bank, was but a mass of darkness.&nbsp; The
first time she reclined in this manner, her heart beat audibly;
in time she lay down as calmly as on the mountain heather; the
perception of the sublime was probably heightened by an
intermingled sense of danger; and perhaps that indifference to
life, which early disappointment forces upon sensitive minds, was
necessary to the first experiment.&nbsp; There was, in the
novelty and strangeness of the position, an excitement which
never wholly passed away, but which became gradually subordinate
to the influence, at once tranquillising and elevating, of the
mingled eternity of motion, sound, and solitude.</p>
<p>One sultry noon, she descended into this retreat with a mind
more than usually disturbed by reflections on the past.&nbsp; She
lay in her favourite position, sometimes gazing on the cataract;
looking sometimes up the steep sylvan acclivities, into the
narrow space of the cloudless ether; sometimes down into the
abyss of the pool, and the deep bright-blue reflections that
opened another immensity below her.&nbsp; The distressing
recollections of the morning, the world and all its littlenesses,
faded from her thoughts like a dream; but her wounded and wearied
spirit drank in too deeply the tranquillising power of the place,
and she dropped asleep upon the tree like a ship-boy on the
mast.</p>
<p>At this moment Mr. Chainmail emerged into daylight, on a
projection of the opposite rock, having struck down through the
woods in search of unsophisticated scenery.&nbsp; The scene he
discovered filled him with delight: he seated himself on the
rock, and fell into one of his romantic reveries; when suddenly
the semblance of a black hat and feather caught his eye among the
foliage of the projecting oak.&nbsp; He started up, shifted his
position, and got a glimpse of a blue gown.&nbsp; It was his lady
of the lake, his enchantress of the ruined castle, divided from
him by a barrier which, at a few yards below, he could almost
overleap, yet unapproachable but by a circuit perhaps of many
hours.&nbsp; He watched with intense anxiety.&nbsp; To listen if
she breathed was out of the question: the noses of a dean and
chapter would have been soundless in the roar of the
torrent.&nbsp; From her extreme stillness, she appeared to sleep:
yet what creature, not desperate, would go wilfully to sleep in
such a place?&nbsp; Was she asleep, then?&nbsp; Nay, was she
alive?&nbsp; She was as motionless as death.&nbsp; Had she been
murdered, thrown from above, and caught in the tree?&nbsp; She
lay too regularly and too composedly for such a
supposition.&nbsp; She was asleep, then, and, in all probability,
her waking would be fatal.&nbsp; He shifted his position.&nbsp;
Below the pool two beetle-browed rocks nearly overarched the
chasm, leaving just such a space at the summit as was within the
possibility of a leap; the torrent roared below in a fearful
gulf.&nbsp; He paused some time on the brink, measuring the
practicability and the danger, and casting every now and then an
anxious glance to his sleeping beauty.&nbsp; In one of these
glances he saw a slight movement of the blue gown, and, in a
moment after, the black hat and feather dropped into the
pool.&nbsp; Reflection was lost for a moment, and, by a sudden
impulse, he bounded over the chasm.</p>
<p>He stood above the projecting oak; the unknown beauty lay like
the nymph of the scene; her long black hair, which the fall of
her hat had disengaged from its fastenings, drooping through the
boughs: he saw that the first thing to be done, was to prevent
her throwing her feet off the trunk, in the first movements of
waking.&nbsp; He sat down on the rock, and placed his feet on the
stem, securing her ankles between his own: one of her arms was
round a branch of the fork, the other lay loosely on her
side.&nbsp; The hand of this arm he endeavoured to reach, by
leaning forward from his seat; he approximated, but could not
touch it: after several tantalising efforts, he gave up the point
in despair.&nbsp; He did not attempt to wake her, because he
feared it might have bad consequences, and he resigned himself to
expect the moment of her natural waking, determined not to stir
from his post, if she should sleep till midnight.</p>
<p>In this period of forced inaction, he could contemplate at
leisure the features and form of his charmer.&nbsp; She was not
one of the slender beauties of romance; she was as plump as a
partridge; her cheeks were two roses, not absolutely damask, yet
verging thereupon; her lips twin-cherries, of equal size; her
nose regular, and almost Grecian; her forehead high, and
delicately fair; her eyebrows symmetrically arched; her
eyelashes, long, black, and silky, fitly corresponding with the
beautiful tresses that hung among the leaves of the oak, like
clusters of wandering grapes.&nbsp; Her eyes were yet to be seen;
but how could he doubt that their opening would be the rising of
the sun, when all that surrounded their fringy portals was
radiant as &ldquo;the forehead of the morning sky?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<p>Though Meirion&rsquo;s rocks, and hills of heath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Repel the distant sight,<br />
Yet where, than those bleak hills beneath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is found more true delight?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> length the young lady
awoke.&nbsp; She was startled at the sudden sight of the
stranger, and somewhat terrified at the first perception of her
position.&nbsp; But she soon recovered her self-possession, and,
extending her hand to the offered hand of Mr. Chainmail, she
raised herself up on the tree, and stepped on the rocky bank.</p>
<p>Mr. Chainmail solicited permission to attend her to her home,
which the young lady graciously conceded.&nbsp; They emerged from
the woody dingle, traversed an open heath, wound along a mountain
road by the shore of a lake, descended to the deep bed of another
stream, crossed it by a series of stepping-stones, ascended to
some height on the opposite side, and followed upwards the line
of the stream, till the banks opened into a spacious
amphitheatre, where stood, in its fields and meadows, the
farmhouse of Ap-Llymry.</p>
<p>During this walk, they had kept up a pretty animated
conversation.&nbsp; The lady had lost her hat, and, as she turned
towards Mr. Chainmail, in speaking to him, there was no envious
projection of brim to intercept the beams of those radiant eyes
he had been so anxious to see unclosed.&nbsp; There was in them a
mixture of softness and brilliancy, the perfection of the beauty
of female eyes, such as some men have passed through life without
seeing, and such as no man ever saw, in any pair of eyes, but
once; such as can never be seen and forgotten.&nbsp; Young
Crotchet had seen it; he had not forgotten it; but he had
trampled on its memory, as the renegade tramples on the emblems
of a faith which his interest only, and not his heart or his
reason, has rejected.</p>
<p>Her hair streamed over her shoulders; the loss of the black
feather had left nothing but the rustic costume, the blue gown,
the black stockings, and the ribbon-tied shoes.&nbsp; Her voice
had that full soft volume of melody which gives to common speech
the fascination of music.&nbsp; Mr. Chainmail could not reconcile
the dress of the damsel with her conversation and manners.&nbsp;
He threw out a remote question or two, with the hope of solving
the riddle, but, receiving no reply, he became satisfied that she
was not disposed to be communicative respecting herself, and,
fearing to offend her, fell upon other topics.&nbsp; They talked
of the scenes of the mountains, of the dingle, the ruined castle,
the solitary lake.&nbsp; She told him, that lake lay under the
mountains behind her home, and the coracle and the pass at the
extremity, saved a long circuit to the nearest village, whither
she sometimes went to inquire for letters.</p>
<p>Mr. Chainmail felt curious to know from whom these letters
might be; and he again threw out two or three fishing questions,
to which, as before, he obtained no answer.</p>
<p>The only living biped they met in their walk was the
unfortunate Harry Ap-Heather, with whom they fell in by the
stepping-stones, who, seeing the girl of his heart hanging on
another man&rsquo;s arm, and, concluding at once that they were
&ldquo;keeping company,&rdquo; fixed on her a mingled look of
surprise, reproach, and tribulation; and, unable to control his
feelings under the sudden shock, burst into a flood of tears, and
blubbered till the rocks re-echoed.</p>
<p>They left him mingling his tears with the stream, and his
lamentations with its murmurs.&nbsp; Mr. Chainmail inquired who
that strange creature might be, and what was the matter with
him.&nbsp; The young lady answered, that he was a very worthy
young man, to whom she had been the innocent cause of much
unhappiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pity him sincerely,&rdquo; said Mr. Chainmail and,
nevertheless, he could scarcely restrain his laughter at the
exceedingly original figure which the unfortunate rustic lover
had presented by the stepping-stones.</p>
<p>The children ran out to meet their dear Miss Susan, jumped all
round her, and asked what was become of her hat.&nbsp; Ap-Llymry
came out in great haste, and invited Mr. Chainmail to walk in and
dine: Mr. Chainmail did not wait to be asked twice.&nbsp; In a
few minutes the whole party, Miss Susan and Mr. Chainmail, Mr.
and Mrs. Ap-Llymry, and progeny, were seated over a clean
homespun table cloth, ornamented with fowls and bacon, a pyramid
of potatoes, another of cabbage, which Ap-Llymry said &ldquo;was
poiled with the pacon, and as coot as marrow,&rdquo; a bowl of
milk for the children, and an immense brown jug of foaming ale,
with which Ap-Llymry seemed to delight in filling the horn of his
new guest.</p>
<p>Shall we describe the spacious apartment, which was at once
kitchen, hall, and dining-room,&mdash;the large dark rafters, the
pendent bacon and onions, the strong old oaken furniture, the
bright and trimly-arranged utensils?&nbsp; Shall we describe the
cut of Ap-Llymry&rsquo;s coat, the colour and tie of his
neckcloth, the number of buttons at his knees,&mdash;the
structure of Mrs. Ap-Llymry&rsquo;s cap, having lappets over the
ears, which were united under the chin, setting forth especially
whether the bond of union were a pin or a ribbon?&nbsp; We shall
leave this tempting field of interesting expatiation to those
whose brains are high-pressure steam-engines for spinning prose
by the furlong, to be trumpeted in paid-for paragraphs in the
quack&rsquo;s corner of newspapers: modern literature having
attained the honourable distinction of sharing, with blacking and
Macassar oil, the space which used to be monopolised by
razor-strops and the lottery; whereby that very enlightened
community, the reading public, is tricked into the perusal of
much exemplary nonsense; though the few who see through the
trickery have no reason to complain, since as &ldquo;good wine
needs no bush,&rdquo; so, <i>ex vi oppositi</i>, these bushes of
venal panegyric point out very clearly that the things they
celebrate are not worth reading.</p>
<p>The party dined very comfortably in a corner most remote from
the fire: and Mr. Chainmail very soon found his head swimming
with two or three horns of ale, of a potency to which even he was
unaccustomed.&nbsp; After dinner Ap-Llymry made him finish a
bottle of mead, which he willingly accepted, both as an excuse to
remain and as a drink of the dark ages, which he had no doubt was
a genuine brewage from uncorrupted tradition.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as soon as the cloth was removed, the
children had brought out Miss Susannah&rsquo;s harp.&nbsp; She
began, without affectation, to play and sing to the children, as
was her custom of an afternoon, first in their own language, and
their national melodies, then in English; but she was soon
interrupted by a general call of little voices for &ldquo;Ouf! di
giorno.&rdquo;&nbsp; She complied with the request, and sang the
ballad from Pa&euml;r&rsquo;s <i>Camilla</i>: &ldquo;Un d&igrave;
carco il mulinaro.&rdquo;&nbsp; The children were very familiar
with every syllable of this ballad, which had been often fully
explained to them.&nbsp; They danced in a circle with the burden
of every verse, shouting out the chorus with good articulation
and joyous energy; and at the end of the second stanza, where the
traveller has his nose pinched by his grandmother&rsquo;s ghost,
every nose in the party was nipped by a pair of little
fingers.&nbsp; Mr. Chainmail, who was not prepared for the
process, came in for a very energetic tweak from a chubby girl
that sprang suddenly on his knees for the purpose, and made the
roof ring with her laughter.</p>
<p>So passed the time till evening, when Mr. Chainmail moved to
depart.&nbsp; But it turned out on inquiry that he was some miles
from his inn, that the way was intricate, and that he must not
make any difficulty about accepting the farmer&rsquo;s
hospitality till morning.&nbsp; The evening set in with rain: the
fire was found agreeable; they drew around it.&nbsp; The young
lady made tea; and afterwards, from time to time, at Mr.
Chainmail&rsquo;s special request, delighted his ear with
passages of ancient music.&nbsp; Then came a supper of lake
trout, fried on the spot, and thrown, smoking hot, from the pan
to the plate.&nbsp; Then came a brewage, which the farmer called
his nightcap, of which he insisted on Mr. Chainmail&rsquo;s
taking his full share.&nbsp; After which the gentleman remembered
nothing till he awoke, the next morning, to the pleasant
consciousness that he was under the same roof with one of the
most fascinating creatures under the canopy of heaven.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chainmail</span> forgot the Captain
and the route of Giraldus de Barri.&nbsp; He became suddenly
satisfied that the ruined castle in his present neighbourhood was
the best possible specimen of its class, and that it was needless
to carry his researches further.</p>
<p>He visited the farm daily: found himself always welcome;
flattered himself that the young lady saw him with pleasure, and
dragged a heavier chain at every new parting from Miss Susan, as
the children called his nymph of the mountains.&nbsp; What might
be her second name, he had vainly endeavoured to discover.</p>
<p>Mr. Chainmail was in love: but the determination he had long
before formed and fixed in his mind, to marry only a lady of
gentle blood, without a blot in her escutcheon, repressed the
declarations of passion which were often rising to his
lips.&nbsp; In the meantime he left no means untried to pluck out
the heart of her mystery.</p>
<p>The young lady soon divined his passion, and penetrated his
prejudices.&nbsp; She began to look on him with favourable eyes;
but she feared her name and parentage would present an
insuperable barrier to his feudal pride.</p>
<p>Things were in this state when the Captain returned, and
unpacked his maps and books in the parlour of the inn.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Really, Captain, I find so many
objects of attraction in this neighbourhood, that I would gladly
postpone our purpose.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Undoubtedly this
neighbourhood has many attractions; but there is something very
inviting in the scheme you laid down.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;No doubt there is something very
tempting in the route of Giraldus de Barri.&nbsp; But there are
better things in this vicinity even than that.&nbsp; To tell you
the truth, Captain, I have fallen in love.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;What! while I have been
away?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Even so.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;The plunge must have been
very sudden, if you are already over head and ears.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;As deep as
Llyn-y-dreiddiad-vrawd.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;And what may that be?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;A pool not far off: a
resting-place of a mountain stream which is said to have no
bottom.&nbsp; There is a tradition connected with it; and here is
a ballad on it, at your service.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:
center">LLYN-Y-DREIDDIAD-VRAWD.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE POOL OF THE DIVING FRIAR.</span></p>
<p>Gwenwynwyn withdrew from the feasts of his hall:<br />
He slept very little, he prayed not at all:<br />
He pondered, and wandered, and studied alone;<br />
And sought, night and day, the philosopher&rsquo;s stone.</p>
<p>He found it at length, and he made its first proof<br />
By turning to gold all the lead of his roof:<br />
Then he bought some magnanimous heroes, all fire,<br />
Who lived but to smite and be smitten for hire.</p>
<p>With these on the plains like a torrent he broke;<br />
He filled the whole country with flame and with smoke;<br />
He killed all the swine, and he broached all the wine;<br />
He drove off the sheep, and the beeves, and the kine;</p>
<p>He took castles and towns; he cut short limbs and lives;<br />
He made orphans and widows of children and wives:<br />
This course many years he triumphantly ran,<br />
And did mischief enough to be called a great man.</p>
<p>When, at last, he had gained all for which he held striven,<br
/>
He bethought him of buying a passport to heaven;<br />
Good and great as he was, yet he did not well know,<br />
How soon, or which way, his great spirit might go.</p>
<p>He sought the grey friars, who beside a wild stream,<br />
Refected their frames on a primitive scheme;<br />
The gravest and wisest Gwenwynwyn found out,<br />
All lonely and ghostly, and angling for trout.</p>
<p>Below the white dash of a mighty cascade,<br />
Where a pool of the stream a deep resting-place made,<br />
And rock-rooted oaks stretched their branches on high,<br />
The friar stood musing, and throwing his fly.</p>
<p>To him said Gwenwynwyn, &ldquo;Hold, father, here&rsquo;s
store,<br />
For the good of the church, and the good of the poor;&rdquo;<br
/>
Then he gave him the stone; but, ere more he could speak,<br />
Wrath came on the friar, so holy and meek.</p>
<p>He had stretched forth his hand to receive the red gold,<br />
And he thought himself mocked by Gwenwynwyn the Bold;<br />
And in scorn of the gift, and in rage at the giver,<br />
He jerked it immediately into the river.</p>
<p>Gwenwynwyn, aghast, not a syllable spake;<br />
The philosopher&rsquo;s stone made a duck and a drake;<br />
Two systems of circles a moment were seen,<br />
And the stream smoothed them off, as they never had been.</p>
<p>Gwenwynwyn regained, and uplifted his voice,<br />
&ldquo;Oh friar, grey friar, full rash was thy choice;<br />
The stone, the good stone, which away thou hast thrown,<br />
Was the stone of all stones, the philosopher&rsquo;s
stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friar looked pale, when his error he knew;<br />
The friar looked red, and the friar looked blue;<br />
And heels over head, from the point of a rock,<br />
He plunged, without stopping to pull off his frock.</p>
<p>He dived very deep, but he dived all in vain,<br />
The prize he had slighted he found not again;<br />
Many times did the friar his diving renew,<br />
And deeper and deeper the river still grew.</p>
<p>Gwenwynwyn gazed long, of his senses in doubt,<br />
To see the grey friar a diver so stout;<br />
Then sadly and slowly his castle he sought,<br />
And left the friar diving, like dabchick distraught.</p>
<p>Gwenwynwyn fell sick with alarm and despite,<br />
Died, and went to the devil, the very same night;<br />
The magnanimous heroes he held in his pay<br />
Sacked his castle, and marched with the plunder away.</p>
<p>No knell on the silence of midnight was rolled<br />
For the flight of the soul of Gwenwynwyn the Bold.<br />
The brethren, unfeed, let the mighty ghost pass,<br />
Without praying a prayer, or intoning a mass.</p>
<p>The friar haunted ever beside the dark stream;<br />
The philosopher&rsquo;s stone was his thought and his dream:<br
/>
And day after day, ever head under heels<br />
He dived all the time he could spare from his meals.</p>
<p>He dived, and he dived, to the end of his days,<br />
As the peasants oft witnessed with fear and amaze.<br />
The mad friar&rsquo;s diving-place long was their theme,<br />
And no plummet can fathom that pool of the stream.</p>
<p>And still, when light clouds on the midnight winds ride,<br />
If by moonlight you stray on the lone river-side,<br />
The ghost of the friar may be seen diving there,<br />
With head in the water, and heels in the air.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Well, your ballad is very
pleasant: you shall show me the scene, and I will sketch it; but
just now I am more interested about your love.&nbsp; What heroine
of the twelfth century has risen from the ruins of the old
castle, and looked down on you from the ivied battlements?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;You are nearer the mark than you
suppose.&nbsp; Even from those battlements a heroine of the
twelfth century has looked down on me.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Oh! some vision of an ideal
beauty.&nbsp; I suppose the whole will end in another tradition
and a ballad.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Genuine flesh and blood; as
genuine as Lady Clarinda.&nbsp; I will tell you the story.</p>
<p>Mr. Chainmail narrated his adventures.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Then you seem to have found
what you wished.&nbsp; Chance has thrown in your way what none of
the gods would have ventured to promise you.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Yes, but I know nothing of her
birth and parentage.&nbsp; She tells me nothing of herself, and I
have no right to question her directly.</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;She appears to be expressly
destined for the light of your baronial hall.&nbsp; Introduce me
in this case, two heads are better than one.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;No, I thank you.&nbsp; Leave me to
manage my chance of a prize, and keep you to your own chance of
a&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Captain Fitzchrome</i>.&mdash;Blank.&nbsp; As you
please.&nbsp; Well, I will pitch my tent here, till I have filled
my portfolio, and shall be glad of as much of your company as you
can spare from more attractive society.</p>
<p>Matters went on pretty smoothly for several days, when an
unlucky newspaper threw all into confusion.&nbsp; Mr. Chainmail
received newspapers by the post, which came in three times a
week.&nbsp; One morning, over their half-finished breakfast, the
Captain had read half a newspaper very complacently, when
suddenly he started up in a frenzy, hurled over the breakfast
table, and, bouncing from the apartment, knocked down Harry Ap
Heather, who was coming in at the door to challenge his supposed
rival to a boxing-match.</p>
<p>Harry sprang up, in a double rage, and intercepted Mr.
Chainmail&rsquo;s pursuit of the Captain, placing himself in the
doorway, in a pugilistic attitude.&nbsp; Mr. Chainmail, not being
disposed for this mode of combat, stepped back into the parlour,
took the poker in his right hand, and displacing the loose bottom
of a large elbow chair, threw it over his left arm as a
shield.&nbsp; Harry, not liking the aspect of the enemy in this
imposing attitude, retreated with backward steps into the
kitchen, and tumbled over a cur, which immediately fastened on
his rear.</p>
<p>Mr. Chainmail, half-laughing, half-vexed, anxious to overtake
the Captain, and curious to know what was the matter with him,
pocketed the newspaper, and sallied forth, leaving Harry roaring
for a doctor and tailor, to repair the lacerations of his outward
man.</p>
<p>Mr. Chainmail could find no trace of the Captain.&nbsp;
Indeed, he sought him but in one direction, which was that
leading to the farm; where he arrived in due time, and found Miss
Susan alone.&nbsp; He laid the newspaper on the table, as was his
custom, and proceeded to converse with the young lady: a
conversation of many pauses, as much of signs as of words.&nbsp;
The young lady took up the paper, and turned it over and over,
while she listened to Mr. Chainmail, whom she found every day
more and more agreeable, when suddenly her eye glanced on
something which made her change colour, and dropping the paper on
the ground, she rose from her seat, exclaiming: &ldquo;Miserable
must she be who trusts any of your faithless sex! never, never,
never, will I endure such misery twice.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
vanished up the stairs.&nbsp; Mr. Chainmail was petrified.&nbsp;
At length, he cried aloud: &ldquo;Cornelius Agrippa must have
laid a spell on this accursed newspaper;&rdquo; and was turning
it over, to look for the source of the mischief, when Mrs. Ap
Llymry made her appearance.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Ap Llymry</i>.&mdash;What have you done to poor dear
Miss Susan? she is crying ready to break her heart.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;So help me the memory of Richard
Coeur-de-Lion, I have not the most distant notion of what is the
matter.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Ap Llymry</i>.&mdash;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me, sir; you
must have ill-used her.&nbsp; I know how it is.&nbsp; You have
been keeping company with her, as if you wanted to marry her; and
now, all at once, you have been insulting her.&nbsp; I have seen
such tricks more than once, and you ought to be ashamed of
yourself.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;My dear madam, you wrong me
utterly.&nbsp; I have none but the kindest feelings and the most
honourable purposes towards her.&nbsp; She has been disturbed by
something she has seen in this rascally paper.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Ap Llymry</i>.&mdash;Why, then, the best thing you can
do is to go away, and come again tomorrow.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Not I, indeed, madam.&nbsp; Out of
this house I stir not, till I have seen the young lady, and
obtained a full explanation.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Ap Llymry</i>.&mdash;I will tell Miss Susan what you
say.&nbsp; Perhaps she will come down.</p>
<p>Mr. Chainmail sat with as much patience as he could command,
running over the paper, from column to column.&nbsp; At length he
lighted on an announcement of the approaching marriage of Lady
Clarinda Bossnowl with Mr. Crotchet the younger.&nbsp; This
explained the Captain&rsquo;s discomposure, but the cause of Miss
Susan&rsquo;s was still to be sought: he could not know that it
was one and the same.</p>
<p>Presently, the sound of the longed-for step was heard on the
stairs; the young lady reappeared, and resumed her seat: her eyes
showed that she had been weeping.&nbsp; The gentleman was now
exceedingly puzzled how to begin, but the young lady relieved him
by asking, with great simplicity: &ldquo;What do you wish to have
explained, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;I wish, if I may be permitted, to
explain myself to you.&nbsp; Yet could I first wish to know what
it was that disturbed you in this unlucky paper.&nbsp; Happy
should I be if I could remove the cause of your inquietude!</p>
<p><i>Miss Susannah</i>.&mdash;The cause is already
removed.&nbsp; I saw something that excited painful
recollections; nothing that I could now wish otherwise than as it
is.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Yet, may I ask why it is that I
find one so accomplished living in this obscurity, and passing
only by the name of Miss Susan?</p>
<p><i>Miss Susannah</i>.&mdash;The world and my name are not
friends.&nbsp; I have left the world, and wish to remain for ever
a stranger to all whom I once knew in it.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;You can have done nothing to
dishonour your name.</p>
<p><i>Miss Susannah</i>.&mdash;No, sir.&nbsp; My father has done
that of which the world disapproves, in matters of which I
pretend not to judge.&nbsp; I have suffered for it as I will
never suffer again.&nbsp; My name is my own secret: I have no
other, and that is one not worth knowing.&nbsp; You see what I
am, and all I am.&nbsp; I live according to the condition of my
present fortune, and here, so living, I have found
tranquillity.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Yet, I entreat you, tell me your
name.</p>
<p><i>Miss Susannah</i>.&mdash;Why, sir?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Why, but to throw my hand, my
heart, my fortune, at your feet, if&mdash;.</p>
<p><i>Miss Susannah</i>.&mdash;If my name be worthy of them.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Nay, nay, not so; if your hand and
heart are free.</p>
<p><i>Miss Susannah</i>.&mdash;My hand and heart are free; but
they must be sought from myself, and not from my name.</p>
<p>She fixed her eyes on him, with a mingled expression of
mistrust, of kindness, and of fixed resolution, which the
far-gone <i>inamorato</i> found irresistible.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Then from yourself alone I seek
them.</p>
<p><i>Miss Susannah</i>.&mdash;Reflect. You have prejudices on
the score of parentage.&nbsp; I have not conversed with you so
often without knowing what they are.&nbsp; Choose between them
and me.&nbsp; I too have my own prejudices on the score of
personal pride.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;I would choose you from all the
world, were you even the daughter of the <i>ex&eacute;cuteur des
hautes &oelig;uvres</i>, as the heroine of a romantic story I
once read turned out to be.</p>
<p><i>Miss Susannah</i>.&mdash;I am satisfied.&nbsp; You have now
a right to know my history, and if you repent, I absolve you from
all obligations.</p>
<p>She told him her history; but he was out of the reach of
repentance.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; as at a subsequent
period he said to the captain, &ldquo;she is the daughter of a
money-changer: one who, in the days of Richard the First, would
have been plucked by the beard in the streets: but she is,
according to modern notions, a lady of gentle blood.&nbsp; As to
her father&rsquo;s running away, that is a minor consideration: I
have always understood, from Mr. Mac Quedy, who is a great oracle
in this way, that promises to pay ought not to be kept; the
essence of a safe and economical currency being an interminable
series of broken promises.&nbsp; There seems to be a difference
among the learned as to the way in which the promises ought to be
broken; but I am not deep enough in this casuistry to enter into
such nice distinctions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few days there was a wedding, a pathetic leave-taking of
the farmer&rsquo;s family, a hundred kisses from the bride to the
children, and promises twenty times reclaimed and renewed, to
visit them in the ensuing year.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE INVITATION.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>A cup of wine, that&rsquo;s brisk and fine,<br />
And drink unto the lemon mine.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Master Silence</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> veridicous history began in
May, and the occurrences already narrated have carried it on to
the middle of autumn.&nbsp; Stepping over the interval to
Christmas, we find ourselves in our first locality, among the
chalk hills of the Thames; and we discover our old friend, Mr.
Crotchet, in the act of accepting an invitation, for himself, and
any friends who might be with him, to pass their Christmas Day at
Chainmail Hall, after the fashion of the twelfth century.&nbsp;
Mr. Crochet had assembled about him, for his own Christmas
festivities, nearly the same party which was introduced to the
reader in the spring.&nbsp; Three of that party were
wanting.&nbsp; Dr. Morbific, by inoculating himself once too
often with non-contagious matter, had explained himself out of
the world.&nbsp; Mr. Henbane had also departed, on the wings of
an infallible antidote.&nbsp; Mr. Eavesdrop, having printed in a
magazine some of the after-dinner conversations of the castle,
had had sentence of exclusion passed upon him, on the motion of
the Reverend Doctor Folliott, as a flagitious violator of the
confidences of private life.</p>
<p>Miss Crotchet had become Lady Bossnowl, but Lady Clarinda had
not yet changed her name to Crotchet.&nbsp; She had, on one
pretence and another, procrastinated the happy event, and the
gentleman had not been very pressing; she had, however,
accompanied her brother and sister-in-law, to pass Christmas at
Crotchet Castle.&nbsp; With these, Mr. Mac Quedy, Mr. Philpot,
Mr. Trillo, Mr. Skionar, Mr. Toogood, and Mr. Firedamp were
sitting at breakfast, when the Reverend Doctor Folliott entered
and took his seat at the table.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Well, Mr. Mac Quedy, it is
now some weeks since we have met: how goes on the march of
mind?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Nay, sir; I think you may see that
with your own eyes.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Sir, I have seen it, much
to my discomfiture.&nbsp; It has marched into my rickyard, and
set my stacks on fire, with chemical materials, most
scientifically compounded.&nbsp; It has marched up to the door of
my vicarage, a hundred and fifty strong; ordered me to surrender
half my tithes; consumed all the provisions I had provided for my
audit feast, and drunk up my old October.&nbsp; It has marched in
through my back-parlour shutters, and out again with my silver
spoons, in the dead of the night.&nbsp; The policeman who has
been down to examine says my house has been broken open on the
most scientific principles.&nbsp; All this comes of
education.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;I rather think it comes of
poverty.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No, sir.&nbsp; Robbery,
perhaps, comes of poverty, but scientific principles of robbery
come of education.&nbsp; I suppose the learned friend has written
a sixpenny treatise on mechanics, and the rascals who robbed me
have been reading it.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Your house would have been very
safe, Doctor, if they had had no better science than the learned
friend&rsquo;s to work with.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, that may
be.&nbsp; Excellent potted char.&nbsp; The Lord deliver me from
the learned friend.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;Well, Doctor, for your comfort,
here is a declaration of the learned friend&rsquo;s that he will
never take office.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Then, sir, he will be in
office next week.&nbsp; Peace be with him.&nbsp; Sugar and
cream.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;But, Doctor, are you for Chainmail
Hall on Christmas Day?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;That am I, for there will
be an excellent dinner, though, peradventure, grotesquely
served.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;I have not seen my neighbour since
he left us on the canal.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;He has married a wife, and
brought her home.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Indeed!&nbsp; If she suits him,
she must be an oddity: it will be amusing to see them
together.</p>
<p><i>Lord Bossnowl</i>.&mdash;Very amusing.&nbsp; He! He!&nbsp;
Mr. Firedamp.&nbsp; Is there any water about Chainmail Hall?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;An old moat.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Firedamp</i>.&mdash;I shall die of malaria.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;Shall we have any music?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;An old harper.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Trillo</i>.&mdash;Those fellows are always horridly out
of tune.&nbsp; What will he play?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Old songs and marches.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;Among so many old things, I hope we
shall find Old Philosophy.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;An old woman.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Philpot</i>.&mdash;Perhaps an old map of the river in
the twelfth century.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No doubt.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;How many more old things?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Old hospitality; old wine;
old ale; all the images of old England; an old butler.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Toogood</i>.&mdash;Shall we all be welcome?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Heartily; you will be
slapped on the shoulder, and called Old Boy.</p>
<p><i>Lord Bossnowl</i>.&mdash;I think we should all go in our
old clothes.&nbsp; He! He!</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;You will sit on old
chairs, round an old table, by the light of old lamps, suspended
from pointed arches, which, Mr. Chainmail says, first came into
use in the twelfth century, with old armour on the pillars and
old banners in the roof.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;And what curious piece of
antiquity is the lady of the mansion?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No antiquity there;

<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Have you seen her?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I have.</p>
<p><i>Lady Clarinda</i>.&mdash;Is she pretty?</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr.
Folliott</i>.&mdash;More,&mdash;beautiful.&nbsp; A subject for
the pen of Nonnus or the pencil of Zeuxis.&nbsp; Features of all
loveliness, radiant with all virtue and intelligence.&nbsp; A
face for Antigone.&nbsp; A form at once plump and symmetrical,
that, if it be decorous to divine it by externals, would have
been a model for the Venus of Cnidos.&nbsp; Never was anything so
goodly to look on, the present company excepted; and poor dear
Mrs. Folliott.&nbsp; She reads moral philosophy, Mr. Mac Quedy,
which indeed she might as well let alone; she reads Italian
poetry, Mr. Skionar; she sings Italian music, Mr. Trillo; but,
with all this, she has the greatest of female virtues, for she
superintends the household and looks after her husband&rsquo;s
dinner.&nbsp; I believe she was a mountaineer:

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHAINMAIL HALL.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>Vous autres dictes que ignorance est m&egrave;re
de tous maulx, et dictes vray: mais toutesfoys vous ne la
bannissez mye de vos entendemens, et vivez en elle, avecques
elle, et par elle.&nbsp; C&rsquo;est pourquoy tant de maulx vous
meshaignent de jour en jour.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rabelias</span>, 1. 5. c. 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> party which was assembled on
Christmas Day in Chainmail Hall comprised all the guests of
Crotchet Castle, some of Mr. Chainmail&rsquo;s other neighbours,
all his tenants and domestics, and Captain Fitzchrome.&nbsp; The
hall was spacious and lofty; and with its tall fluted pillars and
pointed arches, its windows of stained glass, its display of arms
and banners intermingled with holly and mistletoe, its blazing
cressets and torches, and a stupendous fire in the centre, on
which blocks of pine were flaming and crackling, had a striking
effect on eyes unaccustomed to such a dining-room.&nbsp; The fire
was open on all sides, and the smoke was caught and carried back
under a funnel-formed canopy into a hollow central pillar.&nbsp;
This fire was the line of demarcation between gentle and simple
on days of high festival.&nbsp; Tables extended from it on two
sides to nearly the end of the hall.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chainmail was introduced to the company.&nbsp; Young
Crotchet felt some revulsion of feeling at the unexpected sight
of one whom he had forsaken, but not forgotten, in a condition
apparently so much happier than his own.&nbsp; The lady held out
her hand to him with a cordial look of more than forgiveness; it
seemed to say that she had much to thank him for.&nbsp; She was
the picture of a happy bride, <i>rayonnante de joie et
d&rsquo;amour</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Crotchet told the Reverend Doctor Folliott the news of the
morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;As you predicted,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;your friend, the learned friend, is in office; he has also
a title; he is now Sir Guy de Vaux.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Thank heaven for that! he
is disarmed from further mischief.&nbsp; It is something, at any
rate, to have that hollow and wind-shaken reed rooted up for ever
from the field of public delusion.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;I suppose, Doctor, you do not like
to see a great reformer in office; you are afraid for your vested
interests.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Not I, indeed, sir; my
vested interests are very safe from all such reformers as the
learned friend.&nbsp; I vaticinate what will be the upshot of all
his schemes of reform.&nbsp; He will make a speech of seven
hours&rsquo; duration, and this will be its quintessence: that,
seeing the exceeding difficulty of putting salt on the
bird&rsquo;s tail, it will be expedient to consider the best
method of throwing dust in the bird&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; All the
rest will be</p>

<p>as Aristophanes has it; and so I leave him, in
Nephelococcygia.</p>
<p>Mr. Mac Quedy came up to the divine as Mr. Crotchet left him,
and said: &ldquo;There is one piece of news which the old
gentleman has not told you.&nbsp; The great firm of Catchflat and
Company, in which young Crotchet is a partner, has stopped
payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Bless me! that accounts
for the young gentleman&rsquo;s melancholy.&nbsp; I thought they
would overreach themselves with their own tricks.&nbsp; The day
of reckoning, Mr. Mac Quedy, is the point which your paper-money
science always leaves out of view.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;I do not see, sir, that the
failure of Catchflat and Company has anything to do with my
science.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;It has this to do with it,
sir, that you would turn the whole nation into a great
paper-money shop, and take no thought of the day of
reckoning.&nbsp; But the dinner is coming.&nbsp; I think you, who
are so fond of paper promises, should dine on the bill of
fare.</p>
<p>The harper at the head of the hall struck up an ancient march,
and the dishes were brought in, in grand procession.</p>
<p>The boar&rsquo;s head, garnished with rosemary, with a citron
in its mouth, led the van.&nbsp; Then came tureens of
plum-porridge; then a series of turkeys, and in the midst of them
an enormous sausage, which it required two men to carry.&nbsp;
Then came geese and capons, tongues and hams, the ancient glory
of the Christmas pie, a gigantic plum pudding, a pyramid of mince
pies, and a baron of beef bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is something new under the sun,&rdquo; said the
divine, as he sat down, &ldquo;to see a great dinner without
fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Fish was for fasts in the twelfth
century.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Well, sir, I prefer our
reformed system of putting fasts and feasts together.&nbsp; Not
but here is ample indemnity.</p>
<p>Ale and wine flowed in abundance.&nbsp; The dinner passed off
merrily: the old harper playing all the while the oldest music in
his repertory.&nbsp; The tables being cleared, he indemnified
himself for lost time at the lower end of the hall, in company
with the old butler and the other domestics, whose attendance on
the banquet had been indispensable.</p>
<p>The scheme of Christmas gambols, which Mr. Chainmail had laid
for the evening, was interrupted by a tremendous clamour
without.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;What have we here?&nbsp;
Mummers?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Nay, I know not.&nbsp; I expect
none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; he added, approaching the door of
the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; vociferated the divine, with the
voice of Stentor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Swing,&rdquo; replied a chorus of discordant
voices.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Ho, ho! here is a piece of
the dark ages we did not bargain for.&nbsp; Here is the
Jacquerie.&nbsp; Here is the march of mind with a witness.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Do you not see that you have
brought disparates together? the Jacquerie and the march of
mind.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Not at all, sir.&nbsp;
They are the same thing, under different names.&nbsp;
&Pi;&omicron;&lambda;&lambda;&#8182;&nu;
&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&#8049;&tau;&omega;&nu;
&mu;&omicron;&rho;&phi;&#8052; &mu;&#8055;&alpha;.&nbsp; What was
Jacquerie in the dark ages is the march of mind in this very
enlightened one&mdash;very enlightened one.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;The cause is the same in both;
poverty in despair.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Very likely; but the effect is
extremely disagreeable.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;It is the natural result,
Mr. Mac Quedy, of that system of state seamanship which your
science upholds.&nbsp; Putting the crew on short allowance, and
doubling the rations of the officers, is the sure way to make a
mutiny on board a ship in distress, Mr. Mac Quedy.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Eh! sir, I uphold no such system
as that.&nbsp; I shall set you right as to cause and
effect.&nbsp; Discontent arises with the increase of
information.&nbsp; That is all.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I said it was the march of
mind.&nbsp; But we have not time for discussing cause and effect
now.&nbsp; Let us get rid of the enemy.</p>
<p>And he vociferated at the top of his voice, &ldquo;What do you
want here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Arms, arms,&rdquo; replied a
hundred voices, &ldquo;Give us the arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;You see, Mr. Chainmail,
this is the inconvenience of keeping an armoury not fortified
with sand bags, green bags, and old bags of all kinds.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Just give them the old spits and
toasting irons, and they will go away quietly.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;My spears and swords! not without
my life.&nbsp; These assailants are all aliens to my land and
house.&nbsp; My men will fight for me, one and all.&nbsp; This is
the fortress of beef and ale.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Eh! sir, when the rabble is up, it
is very indiscriminating.&nbsp; You are e&rsquo;en suffering for
the sins of Sir Simon Steeltrap and the like, who have pushed the
principle of accumulation a little too far.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;The way to keep the people down is
kind and liberal usage.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;That is very well (where it can be
afforded) in the way of prevention; but in the way of cure the
operation must be more drastic.&nbsp; (Taking down a
battle-axe.)&nbsp; I would fain have a good blunderbuss charged
with slugs.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;When I suspended these arms for
ornament, I never dreamed of their being called into use.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Skionar</i>.&mdash;Let me address them.&nbsp; I never
failed to convince an audience that the best thing they could do
was to go away.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Eh! sir, I can bring them to that
conclusion in less time than you.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Crotchet</i>.&mdash;I have no fancy for fighting.&nbsp;
It is a very hard case upon a guest, when the latter end of a
feast is the beginning of a fray.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Mac Quedy</i>.&mdash;Give them the old iron.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Give them the
weapons!&nbsp; <i>Pessimo</i>, <i>medius fidius</i>,
<i>exemplo</i>.&nbsp; Forbid it the spirit of <i>Fr&egrave;re
Jean des Entommeures</i>!&nbsp; No! let us see what the church
militant, in the armour of the twelfth century, will do against
the march of mind.&nbsp; Follow me who will, and stay who
list.&nbsp; Here goes: <i>Pro aris et focis</i>! that is, for
tithe pigs and fires to roast them.</p>
<p>He clapped a helmet on his head, seized a long lance, threw
open the gates, and tilted out on the rabble, side by side with
Mr. Chainmail, followed by the greater portion of the male
inmates of the hall, who had armed themselves at random.</p>
<p>The rabble-rout, being unprepared for such a sortie, fled in
all directions, over hedge and ditch.</p>
<p>Mr. Trillo stayed in the hall, playing a march on the harp, to
inspirit the rest to sally out.&nbsp; The water-loving Mr.
Philpot had diluted himself with so much wine as to be quite
<i>hors de combat</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Toogood, intending to equip
himself in purely defensive armour, contrived to slip a ponderous
coat of mail over his shoulders, which pinioned his arms to his
sides; and in this condition, like a chicken trussed for
roasting, he was thrown down behind a pillar in the first rush of
the sortie.&nbsp; Mr. Crotchet seized the occurrence as a pretext
for staying with him, and passed the whole time of the action in
picking him out of his shell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said the divine, returning; &ldquo;an
inglorious victory; but it deserves a devil and a bowl of
punch.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;A wassail-bowl.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No, sir.&nbsp; No more of
the twelfth century for me.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Nay, Doctor.&nbsp; The twelfth
century has backed you well.&nbsp; Its manners and habits, its
community of kind feelings between master and man, are the true
remedy for these ebullitions.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Toogood</i>.&mdash;Something like it: improved by my
diagram: arts for arms.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;No wassail-bowl for
me.&nbsp; Give me an unsophisticated bowl of punch, which belongs
to that blissful middle period, after the Jacquerie was down, and
before the march of mind was up.&nbsp; But, see, who is
floundering in the water?</p>
<p>Proceeding to the edge of the moat, they fished up Mr.
Firedamp, who had missed his way back, and tumbled in.&nbsp; He
was drawn out, exclaiming, &ldquo;that he had taken his last dose
of malaria in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Tut, man; dry clothes, a
turkey&rsquo;s leg and rump, well devilled, and a quart of strong
punch, will set all to rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wood embers,&rdquo; said Mr. Firedamp, when he had been
accommodated with a change of clothes, &ldquo;there is no
antidote to malaria like the smoke of wood embers; pine
embers.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he placed himself, with his mouth open,
close by the fire.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;Punch, sir, punch: there
is no antidote like punch.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;Well, Doctor, you shall be
indulged.&nbsp; But I shall have my wassail-bowl,
nevertheless.</p>
<p>An immense bowl of spiced wine, with roasted apples hissing on
its surface, was borne into the hall by four men, followed by an
empty bowl of the same dimensions, with all the materials of
arrack punch, for the divine&rsquo;s especial brewage.&nbsp; He
accinged himself to the task with his usual heroism, and having
finished it to his entire satisfaction, reminded his host to
order in the devil.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dr. Folliott</i>.&mdash;I think, Mr. Chainmail, we
can amuse ourselves very well here all night.&nbsp; The enemy may
be still excubant: and we had better not disperse till
daylight.&nbsp; I am perfectly satisfied with my quarters.&nbsp;
Let the young folk go on with their gambols; let them dance to
your old harper&rsquo;s minstrelsy; and if they please to kiss
under the mistletoe, whereof I espy a goodly bunch suspended at
the end of the hall, let those who like it not leave it to those
who do.&nbsp; Moreover, if among the more sedate portion of the
assembly, which, I foresee, will keep me company, there were any
to revive the good old custom of singing after supper, so to fill
up the intervals of the dances, the steps of night would move
more lightly.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Chainmail</i>.&mdash;My Susan will set the example,
after she has set that of joining in the rustic dance, according
to good customs long departed.</p>
<p>After the first dance, in which all classes of the company
mingled, the young lady of the mansion took her harp, and
following the reverend gentleman&rsquo;s suggestion, sang a song
of the twelfth century.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">FLORENCE AND
BLANCHFLOR.</p>
<p>Florence and Blanchflor, loveliest maids,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a summer grove,<br />
Amid the flower-enamelled shades<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Together talked of love.</p>
<p>A clerk sweet Blanchflor&rsquo;s heart had gain&rsquo;d;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair Florence loved a knight:<br />
And each with ardent voice maintained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She loved the worthiest wight.</p>
<p>Sweet Blanchflor praised her scholar dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As courteous, kind, and true!<br />
Fair Florence said her chevalier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could every foe subdue.</p>
<p>And Florence scorned the bookworm vain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sword nor spear could raise;<br />
And Blanchflor scorned the unlettered brain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could sing no lady&rsquo;s praise.</p>
<p>From dearest love, the maidens bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To deadly hatred fell,<br />
Each turned to shun the other&rsquo;s sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And neither said farewell.</p>
<p>The king of birds, who held his court<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within that flowery grove,<br />
Sang loudly: &ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be rare disport<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To judge this suit of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before him came the maidens bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all his birds around,<br />
To judge the cause, if clerk or knight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In love be worthiest found.</p>
<p>The falcon and the sparrow-hawk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stood forward for the fight:<br />
Ready to do, and not to talk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They voted for the knight.</p>
<p>And Blanchflor&rsquo;s heart began to fail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till rose the strong-voiced lark,<br />
And, after him, the nightingale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pleaded for the clerk.</p>
<p>The nightingale prevailed at length,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pleading had such charms;<br />
So eloquence can conquer strength,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And arts can conquer arms.</p>
<p>The lovely Florence tore her hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And died upon the place;<br />
And all the birds assembled there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bewailed the mournful case.</p>
<p>They piled up leaves and flowerets rare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the maiden bright,<br />
And sang: &ldquo;Farewell to Florence fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who too well loved her knight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several others of the party sang in the intervals of the
dances.&nbsp; Mr. Chainmail handed to Mr. Trillo another ballad
of the twelfth century, of a merrier character than the
former.&nbsp; Mr. Trillo readily accommodated it with an air, and
sang:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE PRIEST AND THE
MULBERRY TREE.</p>
<p>Did you hear of the curate who mounted his mare,<br />
And merrily trotted along to the fair?<br />
Of creature more tractable none ever heard;<br />
In the height of her speed she would stop at a word,<br />
And again with a word, when the curate said Hey,<br />
She put forth her mettle, and galloped away.</p>
<p>As near to the gates of the city he rode,<br />
While the sun of September all brilliantly glowed,<br />
The good priest discovered, with eyes of desire,<br />
A mulberry tree in a hedge of wild briar,<br />
On boughs long and lofty, in many a green shoot,<br />
Hung large, black, and glossy, the beautiful fruit.</p>
<p>The curate was hungry, and thirsty to boot;<br />
He shrunk from the thorns, though he longed for the fruit;<br />
With a word he arrested his courser&rsquo;s keen speed,<br />
And he stood up erect on the back of his steed;<br />
On the saddle he stood, while the creature stood still,<br />
And he gathered the fruit, till he took his good fill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure never,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;was a creature so
rare,<br />
So docile, so true, as my excellent mare.<br />
Lo, here, how I stand&rdquo; (and he gazed all around),<br />
&ldquo;As safe and as steady as if on the ground,<br />
Yet how had it been, if some traveller this way,<br />
Had, dreaming no mischief, but chanced to cry Hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood with his head in the mulberry tree,<br />
And he spoke out aloud in his fond reverie.<br />
At the sound of the word, the good mare made a push,<br />
And down went the priest in the wild-briar bush.<br />
He remembered too late, on his thorny green bed,<br />
Much that well may be thought cannot wisely be said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Clarinda, being prevailed on to take the harp in her
turn, sang the following stanzas.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the days of old,<br />
Lovers felt true passion,<br />
Deeming years of sorrow<br />
By a smile repaid.<br />
Now the charms of gold,<br />
Spells of pride and fashion,<br />
Bid them say good morrow<br />
To the best-loved maid.</p>
<p>Through the forests wild,<br />
O&rsquo;er the mountains lonely,<br />
They were never weary<br />
Honour to pursue.<br />
If the damsel smiled<br />
Once in seven years only,<br />
All their wanderings dreary<br />
Ample guerdon knew.</p>
<p>Now one day&rsquo;s caprice<br />
Weighs down years of smiling,<br />
Youthful hearts are rovers,<br />
Love is bought and sold:<br />
Fortune&rsquo;s gifts may cease,<br />
Love is less beguiling;<br />
Wisest were the lovers<br />
In the days of old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The glance which she threw at the captain, as she sang the
last verse, awakened his dormant hopes.&nbsp; Looking round for
his rival, he saw that he was not in the hall; and, approaching
the lady of his heart, he received one of the sweetest smiles of
their earlier days.</p>
<p>After a time, the ladies, and all the females of the party,
retired.&nbsp; The males remained on duty with punch and wassail,
and dropped off one by one into sweet forgetfulness; so that when
the rising sun of December looked through the painted windows on
mouldering embers and flickering lamps, the vaulted roof was
echoing to a mellifluous concert of noses, from the clarionet of
the waiting-boy at one end of the hall, to the double bass of the
Reverend Doctor, ringing over the empty punch-bowl, at the
other.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> this eventful night, young
Crotchet was seen no more on English mould.&nbsp; Whither he had
vanished was a question that could no more be answered in his
case than in that of King Arthur after the battle of
Camlan.&nbsp; The great firm of Catchflat and Company figured in
the Gazette, and paid sixpence in the pound; and it was clear
that he had shrunk from exhibiting himself on the scene of his
former greatness, shorn of the beams of his paper
prosperity.&nbsp; Some supposed him to be sleeping among the
undiscoverable secrets of some barbel-pool in the Thames; but
those who knew him best were more inclined to the opinion that he
had gone across the Atlantic, with his pockets full of surplus
capital, to join his old acquaintance, Mr. Touchandgo, in the
bank of Dotandcarryonetown.</p>
<p>Lady Clarinda was more sorry for her father&rsquo;s
disappointment than her own; but she had too much pride to allow
herself to be put up a second time in the money-market; and when
the Captain renewed his assiduities, her old partiality for him,
combining with a sense of gratitude for a degree of constancy
which she knew she scarcely deserved, induced her, with Lord
Foolincourt&rsquo;s hard-wrung consent, to share with him a more
humble, but less precarious fortune, than that to which she had
been destined as the price of a rotten borough.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
